	abstract = {Studies of the olfactory epithelium model system have demonstrated that production of neurons is regulated by negative feedback. Previously, we showed that a locally produced signal, the TGF$\beta$ superfamily ligand GDF11, regulates the genesis of olfactory receptor neurons by inhibiting proliferation of the immediate neuronal precursors (INPs) that give rise to them. GDF11 is antagonized by follistatin (FST), which is also produced locally. Here, we show that Fst(-/-) mice exhibit dramatically decreased neurogenesis, a phenotype that can only be partially explained by increased GDF11 activity. Instead, a second FST-binding factor, activin $\beta$B (ACT$\beta$B), inhibits neurogenesis by a distinct mechanism: whereas GDF11 inhibits expansion of INPs, ACT$\beta$B inhibits expansion of stem and early progenitor cells. We present data supporting the concept that these latter cells, previously considered two distinct types, constitute a dynamic stem/progenitor population in which individual cells alternate expression of Sox2 and/or Ascl1. In addition, we demonstrate that interplay between ACT$\beta$B and GDF11 determines whether stem/progenitor cells adopt a glial versus neuronal fate. Altogether, the data indicate that the transition between stem cells and committed progenitors is neither sharp nor irreversible and that GDF11, ACT$\beta$B and FST are crucial components of a circuit that controls both total cell number and the ratio of neuronal versus glial cells in this system. Thus, our findings demonstrate a close connection between the signals involved in the control of tissue size and those that regulate the proportions of different cell types.},

	abstract = {Severe sepsis is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. High mortality rates in sepsis are frequently associated with neutropenia. Despite the central role of neutrophils in innate immunity, the mechanisms causing neutropenia during sepsis remain elusive. Here, we show that neutropenia is caused in part by apoptosis and is sustained by a block of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) differentiation. Using a sepsis murine model, we found that the human opportunistic bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa caused neutrophil depletion and expansion of the HSC pool in the bone marrow. "Septic" HSCs were significantly impaired in competitive repopulation assays and defective in generating common myeloid progenitors and granulocyte-monocyte progenitors, resulting in lower rates of myeloid differentiation in vitro and in vivo. Delayed myeloid-neutrophil differentiation was further mapped using a lysozyme-green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter mouse. Pseudomonas's lipopolysaccharide was necessary and sufficient to induce myelosuppresion and required intact TLR4 signaling. Our results establish a previously unrecognized link between HSC regulation and host response in severe sepsis and demonstrate a novel role for TLR4.},

In addition, many cancers have an inflammatory microenvironment that promotes tumor growth. Here, we show that inflammatory infiltration synergizes with tissue regeneration to induce DNA sequence rearrangements in vivo. Chronically inflamed issues that are continuously regenerating are thus at an increased risk for mutagenesis and malignant transformation. Further, rapidly dividing tumor cells in an inflammatory microenvironment can also acquire mutations, which have been shown to contribute to drug resistance and disease recurrence. Finally, inflammation-induced tissue regeneration sensitizes tissues to DNA damaging environmental exposures and chemotherapeutics. The work described here thus increases our understanding of how inflammation leads to genetic changes that drive cancer formation and recurrence.},

	abstract = {Exposure to ionizing radiation and other DNA-damaging carcinogens is strongly associated with induction of malignancies. Prevailing paradigms attribute this association to the induction of oncogenic mutations, as the incidence of oncogenic events is thought to limit initiation and progression of cancers. On the other hand, random mutagenic and genotoxic effects of irradiation are likely to alter progenitor cell populations and the microenvironment, thus altering the selective effects of oncogenic mutations. Using competitive bone marrow transplantation experiments in mice, we show that ionizing irradiation leads to a persistent decline in the numbers and fitness of hematopoietic stem cells, in part resulting from persistent induction of reactive oxygen species. Previous irradiation dramatically alters the selective effects of some oncogenic mutations, substantially inhibiting clonal expansion and leukemogenesis driven by Bcr-Abl or activated N-Ras oncogenes but enhancing the selection for and leukemogenesis driven by the activated Notch1 mutant ICN. Irradiation-dependent selection for ICN expression occurs in a hematopoietic stem cell-enriched pool, which should facilitate the accumulation of additional oncogenic events at a committed T-progenitor stage critical for formation of T-lymphocytic leukemia stem cells. Enhancement of ICN-driven selection and leukemogenesis by previous irradiation is in part non-cell autonomous, as partial restoration of normal hematopoiesis can reverse these effects of irradiation. These studies show that irradiation substantially alters the adaptive landscape in hematopoietic progenitors and suggest that the causal link between irradiation and carcinogenesis might involve increased selection for particular oncogenic mutations.},

	abstract = {The development of the pancreas depends on epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and their receptors (FGFRs 1-4) have been identified as mediators of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions in different organs. We show here that FGFR-2 IIIb and its ligands FGF-1, FGF-7, and FGF-10 are expressed throughout pancreatic development. We also show that in mesenchyme-free cultures of embryonic pancreatic epithelium FGF-1, FGF-7, and FGF-10 stimulate the growth, morphogenesis, and cytodifferentiation of the exocrine cells of the pancreas. The role of FGFs signaling through FGFR-2 IIIb was further investigated by inhibiting FGFR-2 IIIb signaling in organocultures of pancreatic explants (epithelium + mesenchyme) by using either antisense FGFR-2 IIIb oligonucleotides or a soluble recombinant FGFR-2 IIIb protein. Abrogation of FGFR-2 IIIb signaling resulted in a considerable reduction in the size of the explants and in a 2-fold reduction of the development of the exocrine cells. These results demonstrate that FGFs signaling through FGFR-2 IIIb play an important role in the development of the exocrine pancreas.},

	abstract = {Background Many biological processes are characterized by allometric relations of the type Y = Y 0 M b between an observable Y and body mass M , which pervade at multiple levels of organization. In what regards the hematopoietic stem cell pool, there is experimental evidence that the size of the hematopoietic stem cell pool is conserved in mammals. However, demands for blood cell formation vary across mammals and thus the size of the active stem cell compartment could vary across species. Methodology/Principle Findings Here we investigate the allometric scaling of the hematopoietic system in a large group of mammalian species using reticulocyte counts as a marker of the active stem cell pool. Our model predicts that the total number of active stem cells, in an adult mammal, scales with body mass with the exponent ¾. Conclusion/Significance The scaling predicted here provides an intuitive justification of the Hayflick hypothesis and supports the current view of a small active stem cell pool supported by a large, quiescent reserve. The present scaling shows excellent agreement with the available (indirect) data for smaller mammals. The small size of the active stem cell pool enhances the role of stochastic effects in the overall dynamics of the hematopoietic system.},

	abstract = {Apc, a negative regulator of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, is a bona-fide tumor suppressor whose loss of function results in intestinal polyposis. APC is located in a commonly deleted region on human chromosome 5q, associated with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), suggesting that haploinsufficiency of APC contributes to the MDS phenotype. Analysis of the hematopoietic system of mice with the Apc(min) allele that results in a premature stop codon and loss of function showed no abnormality in steady state hematopoiesis. Bone marrow derived from Apc(min) mice showed enhanced repopulation potential, indicating a cell intrinsic gain of function in the long-term hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) population. However, Apc(min) bone marrow was unable to repopulate secondary recipients because of loss of the quiescent HSC population. Apc(min) mice developed a MDS/myeloproliferative phenotype. Our data indicate that Wnt activation through haploinsufficiency of Apc causes insidious loss of HSC function that is only evident in serial transplantation strategies. These data provide a cautionary note for HSC-expansion strategies through Wnt pathway activation, provide evidence that cell extrinsic factors can contribute to the development of myeloid disease, and indicate that loss of function of APC may contribute to the phenotype observed in patients with MDS and del(5q).},

	abstract = {Organoids made from dissociated progenitor cells undergo tissue-like organization. This in vitro self-organization process is not identical to embryonic organ formation, but it achieves a similar phenotype in vivo. This implies genetic codes do not specify morphology directly; instead, complex tissue architectures may be achieved through several intermediate layers of cross talk between genetic information and biophysical processes. Here we use newborn and adult skin organoids for analyses. Dissociated cells from newborn mouse skin form hair primordia-bearing organoids that grow hairs robustly in vivo after transplantation to nude mice. Detailed time-lapse imaging of 3D cultures revealed unexpected morphological transitions between six distinct phases: dissociated cells, cell aggregates, polarized cysts, cyst coalescence, planar skin, and hair-bearing skin. Transcriptome profiling reveals the sequential expression of adhesion molecules, growth factors, Wnts, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Functional perturbations at different times discern their roles in regulating the switch from one phase to another. In contrast, adult cells form small aggregates, but then development stalls in vitro. Comparative transcriptome analyses suggest suppressing epidermal differentiation in adult cells is critical. These results inspire a strategy that can restore morphological transitions and rescue the hair-forming ability of adult organoids: (i) continuous PKC inhibition and (ii) timely supply of growth factors (IGF, VEGF), Wnts, and MMPs. This comprehensive study demonstrates that alternating molecular events and physical processes are in action during organoid morphogenesis and that the self-organizing processes can be restored via environmental reprogramming. This tissue-level phase transition could drive self-organization behavior in organoid morphogenies beyond the skin.},

We demonstrate the power of WADDINGTON-OT by applying the approach to study 65,781 scRNA-seq profiles collected at 10 time points over 16 days during reprogramming of fibroblasts to iPSCs. We construct a high-resolution map of reprogramming that rediscovers known features; uncovers new alternative cell fates including neural- and placental-like cells; predicts the origin and fate of any cell class; highlights senescent-like cells that may support reprogramming through paracrine signaling; and implicates regulatory models in particular trajectories. Of these findings, we highlight Obox6, which we experimentally show enhances reprogramming efficiency.

By directly imaging these events in living animals, this method permits a detailed assessment of functions previously evaluated by crude assessments of cell counts (homing) or after prolonged periods (engraftment). This protocol offers a new means of investigating the role of cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic molecular regulators of hematopoiesis during the early stages of transplantation, and it is the first to allow the study of cell-cell interactions within the bone marrow in three dimensions and in real time.

In the presence of generation time variability, the average acquired across a population snapshot does not obey the average of a dividing cell over time, apparently contradicting ergodicity between single cells and the population. Instead, we show that the variation observed across snapshots with known cell age is captured by cell histories, a single-cell measure obtained from tracking an arbitrary cell of the population back to the ancestor from which it originated. The correspondence between cells of known age in a population with their histories represents an ergodic principle that provides a new interpretation of population snapshot data. We illustrate the principle using analytical solutions of stochastic gene expression models in cell populations with arbitrary generation time distributions. We further elucidate that the principle breaks down for biochemical reactions that are under selection, such as the expression of genes conveying antibiotic resistance, which gives rise to an experimental criterion with which to probe selection on gene expression fluctuations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here, we address whether this discrepancy can be explained by a redundant and compensatory function of gamma-catenin, a close homolog of beta-catenin. Unexpectedly, we find that combined deficiency of beta- and gamma-catenin in hematopoietic progenitors does not impair their ability to self-renew and to reconstitute all myeloid, erythroid, and lymphoid lineages, even in competitive mixed chimeras and serial transplantations.

One of the 2 stable lineage-primed patterns emerges gradually in each cell with variable timing. Some cells reach a stable morphology and molecular phenotype by the end of the first cell cycle and transmit it clonally. Others fluctuate between the 2 phenotypes over several cell cycles. Our analysis highlights the dynamic nature and variable timing of cell fate commitment in hematopoietic cells, links the gene expression pattern to cell morphology, and identifies a new category of cells with fluctuating phenotypic characteristics, demonstrating the complexity of the fate decision process (which is different from a simple binary switch between 2 options, as it is usually envisioned).},

	abstract = {Morphogens provide positional information for spatial patterns of gene expression during development. However, stochastic effects such as local fluctuations in morphogen concentration and noise in signal transduction make it difficult for cells to respond to their positions accurately enough to generate sharp boundaries between gene expression domains. During development of rhombomeres in the zebrafish hindbrain, the morphogen retinoic acid (RA) induces expression of hoxb1a in rhombomere 4 (r4) and krox20 in r3 and r5. Fluorescent in situ hybridization reveals rough edges around these gene expression domains, in which cells co-express hoxb1a and krox20 on either side of the boundary, and these sharpen within a few hours. Computational analysis of spatial stochastic models shows, surprisingly, that noise in hoxb1a/krox20 expression actually promotes sharpening of boundaries between adjacent segments. In particular, fluctuations in RA initially induce a rough boundary that requires noise in hoxb1a/krox20 expression to sharpen. This finding suggests a novel noise attenuation mechanism that relies on intracellular noise to induce switching and coordinate cellular decisions during developmental patterning. Fluctuations in morphogens often lead to gene expression domains with rough boundaries during development. A mechanism is described whereby intracellular noise can help coordinate cellular decisions during patterning and thereby sharpen expression boundaries. ![Formula][1]{\textless}/img{\textgreater} Mol Syst Biol. 8: 613 [1]: /embed/graphic-1.gif},

Collective cell migration in developmental biology is a particularly fruitful application area for the development of theoretical models to predict the behaviour of complex multicellular systems with many interacting parts. In this context, mathematical models provide a tool to assess the consistency of experimental observations with testable mechanistic hypotheses. In this review, we showcase examples from recent years of multidisciplinary investigations of neural crest cell migration. The neural crest model system has been used to study how collective migration of cell populations is shaped by cell–cell interactions, cell–environmental interactions and heterogeneity between cells. The wide range of emergent behaviours exhibited by neural crest cells in different embryonal locations and in different organisms helps us chart out the spectrum of collective cell migration. At the same time, this diversity in migratory characteristics highlights the need to reconcile or unify the array of currently hypothesized mechanisms through the next generation of experimental data and generalized theoretical descriptions.},

We show that the correlation between radiation outcome and spatial organization of vessels changes signs between relatively low and high vessel density. Specifically, that for relatively low vessel density, radiation efficacy is decreased when vessels are more homogeneously distributed, and the opposite is true, that radiation efficacy is improved, when vessel organisation is normalised in high densities. This result suggests an alteration to the vessel normalization hypothesis which states that normalisation of vascular beds should improve radio- and chemo-therapeutic response, but has failed to be validated in clinical studies. In this alteration, we show that Ripley’s L function allows discrimination between vascular architectures in different density regimes in which the standard hypothesis holds and does not hold. Further, we find that this information can be used to augment quantitative histologic analysis of tumours to aid radiation dose personalisation.},

	doi = {10.7554/eLife.21459},
	abstract = {When an embryo is developing, its cells must communicate with one another to coordinate the processes that shape the body’s tissues and organs. Cells often communicate by releasing signaling molecules that engage with proteins called receptors on the surface of other cells. This triggers a series of events that sends the signal along a “pathway” of biochemical reactions inside the receiving cell and leads to the activation of genes. One such signaling pathway is triggered by the WNT proteins and is used extensively in all animals. The WNT pathway instructs cells to grow and divide, establishes the identity of specific cell types and maintains populations of stem cells that can regenerate tissues in adulthood as well. The WNT pathway must be carefully regulated because various types of cancer can develop if the pathway becomes too active. Some signaling pathways are well conserved between different animals. Many genetic studies into the WNT pathway have focused on animals that are easier to work with in the laboratory, like worms or flies. However, there may be differences in the way these pathways are regulated between these model animals and humans. Therefore, to understand how the WNT pathway operates in humans, it was important to study it in human cells too. Lebensohn et al. have now carried out a series of genetic screens in human cells that contain only one copy of each gene instead of the usual two. These cells – referred to as haploid cells – are ideal for genetic studies because only a single copy of a gene has to be disrupted in order to analyze the consequences of that gene’s loss. The screens searched for genes that regulate WNT signaling: those that keep the pathway “off” in the absence of WNT and those that turn the pathway “on” in response to WNT. By comparing the outcomes of these screens, Lebensohn et al. identified previously unknown regulators and uncovered new roles for known regulators of the WNT pathway. For instance, a regulator called TFAP4, which had not previously been linked to the pathway, was shown to activate WNT signaling. In another case, enzymes that make molecules called glycophosphatidylinositol anchors, and cell-surface proteins that are modified with those anchors, were found to amplify WNT signaling. Lebensohn et al. also identified genes that were needed to sustain the uncontrolled WNT signaling in cells that carried cancer-causing mutations in this pathway. Further studies could now explore if drugs can target these genes, or the molecules encoded by them, to treat cancers in which the WNT pathway is excessively activated. Other studies could also use the same methods to explore more signaling pathways and gain new insights into important biological processes in human cells.},

Biological systems are comprised of interrelated gene regulatory mechanisms, gene-gene interactions, and cellular interactions. These interactions induce low-dimensional structure within the high-dimensional data. Matrix factorization, also known as compressed sensing, learns low-dimensional mathematical representations from high-dimensional data. These factorization techniques can embed assumptions about pleiotropy, epistasis, inter-relationships between complex traits, and context-dependent interactions. They have been applied to uncover new biological knowledge in a breadth of topics ranging from pathway discovery to time course analysis. These techniques have been applied to data from diverse high-throughput omics technologies, including bulk and single-cell data. There are numerous computational techniques within the class of matrix factorization, each of which provides a unique interpretation of the processes in high-dimensional data. We review the visualization and applications of matrix factorization to systems-level analyses, which are diverse and require standardization to enable biological interpretation. Codifying the techniques to decipher biologically relevant features with matrix factorization enables their broad application to discovery beyond the limits of current biological knowledge — answering questions from high-dimensional data that we have not yet thought to ask.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Polyploidy is observed across the tree of life, yet its influence on evolution remains incompletely understood. Polyploidy, usually whole-genome duplication, is proposed to alter the rate of evolutionary adaptation. This could occur through complex effects on the frequency or fitness of beneficial mutations. For example, in diverse cell types and organisms, immediately after a whole-genome duplication, newly formed polyploids missegregate chromosomes and undergo genetic instability. The instability following whole-genome duplications is thought to provide adaptive mutations in microorganisms and can promote tumorigenesis in mammalian cells. Polyploidy may also affect adaptation independently of beneficial mutations through ploidy-specific changes in cell physiology. Here we perform in vitro evolution experiments to test directly whether polyploidy can accelerate evolutionary adaptation. Compared with haploids and diploids, tetraploids undergo significantly faster adaptation. Mathematical modelling suggests that rapid adaptation of tetraploids is driven by higher rates of beneficial mutations with stronger fitness effects, which is supported by whole-genome sequencing and phenotypic analyses of evolved clones. Chromosome aneuploidy, concerted chromosome loss, and point mutations all provide large fitness gains. We identify several mutations whose beneficial effects are manifest specifically in the tetraploid strains. Together, these results provide direct quantitative evidence that in some environments polyploidy can accelerate evolutionary adaptation.},

In order to address this issue, Grimm et al. proposed a protocol for model specification, the so-called ODD protocol, which provides a standard way to describe models. This paper proposes an addition to the ODD protocol which allows the description of an agent-based model as a dynamical system, which provides access to computational and theoretical tools for its analysis. The mathematical framework is that of algebraic models, that is, time-discrete dynamical systems with algebraic structure. It is shown by way of several examples how this mathematical specification can help with model analysis. This mathematical framework can also accommodate other model types such as Boolean networks and the more general logical models, as well as Petri nets.},

In this quest, the role of altruistic punishment has been identified as a mechanism promoting cooperation. Here we investigate the role of altruistic punishment on the emergence and maintenance of cooperation in structured populations exhibiting connectivity patterns recently identified as key elements of social networks. We do so in the framework of Evolutionary Game Theory, employing the Prisoner's Dilemma and the Stag-Hunt metaphors to model the conflict between individual and collective interests regarding cooperation. We find that the impact of altruistic punishment strongly depends on the ratio q/p between the cost of punishing a defecting partner (q) and the actual punishment incurred by the partner (p). We show that whenever q/p{\textless}1, altruistic punishment turns out to be detrimental for cooperation for a wide range of payoff parameters, when compared to the scenario without punishment. The results imply that while locally, the introduction of peer punishment may seem to reduce the chances of free-riding, realistic population structure may drive the population towards the opposite scenario. Hence, structured populations effectively reduce the expected beneficial contribution of punishment to the emergence of cooperation which, if not carefully dosed, may in fact hinder the chances of widespread cooperation.},

Mutual interaction between the UB and MM maintains expression of GDNF in the MM, thereby supporting further outgrowth and branching morphogenesis of the UB, while the MM also grows and aggregates around the branched tips of the UB. Ror2, a member of the Ror family of receptor tyrosine kinases, has been shown to act as a receptor for Wnt5a to mediate noncanonical Wnt signaling. We show that Ror2 is predominantly expressed in the MM during UB induction and that Ror2- and Wnt5a-deficient mice exhibit duplicated ureters and kidneys due to ectopic UB induction. During initial UB formation, these mutant embryos show dysregulated positioning of the MM, resulting in spatiotemporally aberrant interaction between the MM and WD, which provides the WD with inappropriate GDNF signaling. Furthermore, the numbers of proliferating cells in the mutant MM are markedly reduced compared to the wild-type MM. These results indicate an important role of Wnt5a-Ror2 signaling in morphogenesis of the MM to ensure proper epithelial tubular formation of the UB required for kidney development.},

This model is derived from physiologically relevant features of the hematopoietic system, and is analysed using both analytic and numerical methods. Supercritical Hopf bifurcations and saddle-node bifurcations of limit cycles are shown to exist. We make the estimation of kinetic parameters for dogs and then apply the model to cyclical neutropenia (CN) in the grey collie, a rare disorder in which oscillations in all blood cell counts are found. We conclude that the major cause of the oscillations in CN is an increased rate of apoptosis of neutrophil precursors which leads to a destabilization of the hematopoietic stem cell compartment.},

Their function critically depends on complex signal exchanges with the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment in which they reside, but the cellular mechanisms involved in HSC-niche interactions and regulating HSC function in vivo remain elusive. We used a natural mouse parasite, Trichinella spiralis, and multipoint intravital time-lapse confocal microscopy of mouse calvarium BM to test whether HSC-niche interactions may change when hematopoiesis is perturbed. We find that steady-state HSCs stably engage confined niches in the BM whereas HSCs harvested during acute infection are motile and therefore interact with larger niches. These changes are accompanied by increased long-term repopulation ability and expression of CD44 and CXCR4. Administration of a CXCR4 antagonist affects the duration of HSC-niche interactions. These findings suggest that HSC-niche interactions may be modulated during infection.},

	abstract = {Forty years ago, May proved that sufficiently large or complex ecological networks have a probability of persisting that is close to zero, contrary to previous expectations. May analysed large networks in which species interact at random. However, in natural systems pairs of species have well-defined interactions (for example predator-prey, mutualistic or competitive). Here we extend May's results to these relationships and find remarkable differences between predator-prey interactions, which are stabilizing, and mutualistic and competitive interactions, which are destabilizing. We provide analytic stability criteria for all cases. We use the criteria to prove that, counterintuitively, the probability of stability for predator-prey networks decreases when a realistic food web structure is imposed or if there is a large preponderance of weak interactions. Similarly, stability is negatively affected by nestedness in bipartite mutualistic networks. These results are found by separating the contribution of network structure and interaction strengths to stability. Stable predator-prey networks can be arbitrarily large and complex, provided that predator-prey pairs are tightly coupled. The stability criteria are widely applicable, because they hold for any system of differential equations.},

Here we demonstrate that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), identified using nestin expression, constitute an essential HSC niche component. Nestin(+) MSCs contain all the bone-marrow colony-forming-unit fibroblastic activity and can be propagated as non-adherent 'mesenspheres' that can self-renew and expand in serial transplantations. Nestin(+) MSCs are spatially associated with HSCs and adrenergic nerve fibres, and highly express HSC maintenance genes. These genes, and others triggering osteoblastic differentiation, are selectively downregulated during enforced HSC mobilization or beta3 adrenoreceptor activation. Whereas parathormone administration doubles the number of bone marrow nestin(+) cells and favours their osteoblastic differentiation, in vivo nestin(+) cell depletion rapidly reduces HSC content in the bone marrow. Purified HSCs home near nestin(+) MSCs in the bone marrow of lethally irradiated mice, whereas in vivo nestin(+) cell depletion significantly reduces bone marrow homing of haematopoietic progenitors. These results uncover an unprecedented partnership between two distinct somatic stem-cell types and are indicative of a unique niche in the bone marrow made of heterotypic stem-cell pairs.},

	abstract = {The skin is one of the largest organs of the body and is constantly confronted with a range of external stresses including germs, heat and scratches. The outermost part of the skin is called the epidermis and it acts as a barrier to the external environment and works to stop the body from losing water. An abnormally thin or thick epidermis can impair the skin’s ability to perform these roles. As such, the ability of epidermal cells to proliferate (i.e. divide to make new cells) is tightly regulated, both when the animal first develops and when it ages. However, most of the underlying mechanisms that regulate these processes are unknown. Watanabe et al. have now identified type XVII collagen (called COL17 for short) as a key molecule that controls how often epidermal cells in skin from mice and humans divide. COL17 is a protein that is made in the deepest layer of the epidermis, and it prevents the epidermis from thickening in newborn mice by coordinating with the Wnt signaling pathway. This signaling pathway, amongst other things, controls how often some cells divide. Older mice have a thicker epidermis than their younger counterparts. Watanabe et al. revealed that the distribution of COL17 in the epidermis also changes dramatically with age in mice and humans. Further experiments with mice showed that introducing COL17 back into the epidermis helped the tissue retain a more youthful state even in animals that had reached an old age. Together these findings give scientists a better understanding of how the ability of epidermal cells to divide is regulated at various stages in a mammal’s life. The new findings also point to COL17 as a promising component in future anti-aging strategies targeted at the skin. Yet first, further work will be needed to uncover how the production of COL17 is controlled in the epidermis.},

To explore the cellular and molecular mechanism of Ovol1 function, we have examined the mutant testis phenotype during the first wave of spermatogenesis in juvenile mice. Consistent with the detection of Ovol1 transcripts in pachytene spermatocytes of the meiotic prophase, Ovol1 -deficient germ cells were defective in progressing through the pachytene stage. The pachytene arrest was accompanied by an inefficient exit from proliferation, increased apoptosis and an abnormal nuclear localization of the G2-M cell cycle regulator cyclin B1, but was not associated with apparent chromosomal or recombination defects. Transcriptional profiling and northern blot analysis revealed reduced expression of pachytene markers in the mutant, providing molecular evidence that pachytene differentiation was defective. In addition, the expression of Id2 (inhibitor of differentiation 2), a known regulator of spermatogenesis, was upregulated in Ovol1 -deficient pachytene spermatocytes and repressed by Ovol1 in reporter assays. Taken together, our studies demonstrate a role for Ovol1 in regulating pachytene progression of male germ cells, and identify Id2 as a Ovol1 target.},

	abstract = {Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), as a crucial process in embryonic development and cancer metastasis, has been investigated extensively. However, how to quantify the global stability and transition dynamics for EMT under fluctuations remains to be elucidated. Starting from a core EMT genetic circuit composed of three key proteins or microRNAs (microRNA-200, ZEB and SNAIL), we uncovered the potential landscape for the EMT process. Three attractors emerge from the landscape, which correspond to epithelial, mesenchymal and partial EMT states respectively. Based on the landscape, we analyzed two important quantities of the EMT system: the barrier heights between different basins of attraction that describe the degree of difficulty for EMT or backward transition, and the mean first passage time (MFPT) that characterizes the kinetic transition rate. These quantities can be harnessed as measurements for the stability of cell types and the degree of difficulty of transitions between different cell types. We also calculated the minimum action paths (MAPs) by path integral approaches. The MAP delineates the transition processes between different cell types quantitatively. We propose two different EMT processes: a direct EMT from E to P, and a step-wise EMT going through an intermediate state, depending on different extracellular environments. The landscape and kinetic paths we acquired offer a new physical and quantitative way for understanding the mechanisms of EMT processes, and indicate the possible roles for the intermediate states.},

In contrast, leukemia initiation by transforming alleles putatively affecting either HSCs or progenitors is inhibited in the absence of either PKM2 or LDHA, indicating that the cell-state-specific responses to metabolic manipulation in hematopoiesis do not apply to the setting of leukemia.

In a stringent statistical analysis of data from {\textgreater} 3,000 tumors, we find that the co-occurrence and mutual exclusivity relationships between cancer driver alterations change quite extensively in different types of cancer. This cannot be accounted for by variation in tumor heterogeneity or unrecognized cancer subtypes. Rather, it suggests that how genomic alterations interact cooperatively or partially redundantly to driver cancer changes in different types of cancers. This re-wiring of epistasis across cell types is likely to be a basic feature of genetic architecture, with important implications for understanding the evolution of multicellularity and human genetic diseases.

In pre-BI cells, Ikaros modulated lambda5 expression in competition with the transcriptional activator EBF. This required Ikaros binding to the Igll1 (lambda5) promoter and was abolished either by mutation of the Ikaros DNA-binding domain or by deletion of a single Ikaros site from the Igll1 promoter. At the transition from the pre-BI to pre-BII stage, the expression of the Ikaros family member Aiolos was upregulated and required for the efficient silencing of Igll1. Aiolos expression was controlled by pre-BCR signals via the adaptor protein SLP-65.

The Axin scaffold and associated glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) have central roles in both assemblies, but the transduction mechanism from the receptor to the destruction complex is contentious. We report that Wnt signaling is governed by phosphorylation regulation of the Axin scaffolding function. Phosphorylation by GSK3 kept Axin activated ("open") for $\beta$-catenin interaction and poised for engagement of LRP6. Formation of the Wnt-induced LRP6-Axin signaling complex promoted Axin dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase-1 and inactivated ("closed") Axin through an intramolecular interaction. Inactivation of Axin diminished its association with $\beta$-catenin and LRP6, thereby inhibiting $\beta$-catenin phosphorylation and enabling activated LRP6 to selectively recruit active Axin for inactivation reiteratively. Our findings reveal mechanisms for scaffold regulation and morphogen signaling.},

	abstract = {A multiscale model for vascular tumour growth is presented which includes systems of ordinary differential equations for the cell cycle and regula- tion of apoptosis in individual cells, coupled to partial differential equations for the spatio-temporal dynamics of nutrient and key signalling chemicals. Fur- thermore, these subcellular and tissue layers are incorporated into a cellular automaton framework for cancerous and normal tissue with an embedded vas- cular network. The model is the extension of previous work and includes novel features such as cell movement and contact inhibition. We present a detailed simulation study of the effects of these additions on the invasive behaviour of tumour cells and the tumour’s response to chemotherapy. In particular, we find that cell movement alone increases the rate of tumour growth and expansion, but that increasing the tumour cell carrying capacity leads to the formation of less invasive dense hypoxic tumours containing fewer tumour cells. However, when an increased carrying capacity is combined with significant tumour cell movement, the tumour grows and spreads more rapidly, accompanied by large spatio-temporal fluctuations in hypoxia, and hence in the number of quies- cent cells. Since, in the model, hypoxic/quiescent cells produce VEGF which stimulates vascular adaptation, such fluctuations can dramatically affect drug delivery and the degree of success of chemotherapy.},

	abstract = {The brain receives information from the world through the senses. In particular, cells called sensory neurons can detect signals from the environment and relay the information to the brain. A critical test of how well we understand the role of a given sensory neuron is whether it is possible to predict its activity under natural conditions. Previous research has succeeded in predicting the responses of sensory neurons in animals that were anaesthetised. However, it has been difficult to extend this approach to awake animals. Mice and other rodents rely on their whiskers to tell them about their surroundings. Campagner et al. set out to predict how the sensory neurons that send information from whiskers (or ‘whisker neurons’) to the brain would respond in awake mice that were actively exploring an object in their environment. The approach involved using high-speed video (1,000 frames per second) to film the whiskers while the mice used them to explore a thin metal pole. At the same time, Campagner et al. recorded the electrical activity of the whisker neurons. The videos were used to calculate the forces acting on the whiskers, and then computational models were used to relate the activity of the neurons to the forces. This approach allowed Campagner et al. to predict the responses of the whisker neurons, even when the mice were exploring the pole freely and unpredictably, simply from knowledge of the forces that were acting on the whiskers. Together, these findings move the field of neuroscience forward by showing that sensory signals and neuronal responses can be correlated even in an awake animal. A key challenge for the future will be to further extend the approach to investigate how the signal conveyed by sensory neurons is transformed by neural circuits within the brain.},

Competition models of cellular species help to elucidate stem cell dynamics in the bone marrow microenvironment (or niche), and to determine how these dynamics impact leukaemia progression. Here we develop two models that target acute myeloid leukaemia with particular focus on the mechanisms that control proliferation via feedback signalling. It is within regions of parameter space permissive of coexistence that the effects of competition are most subtle and the clinical outcome least certain. Steady state and linear stability analyses identify parameter regions that allow for coexistence to occur, and allow us to characterise behaviour near critical points. Where analytical expressions are no longer informative, we proceed statistically and sample parameter space over a coexistence region. We find that the rates of proliferation and differentiation of healthy progenitors exert key control over coexistence. We also show that inclusion of a regulatory feedback onto progenitor cells promotes healthy haematopoiesis at the expense of leukaemia, and that - somewhat paradoxically - within the coexistence region feedback increases the sensitivity of the system to dominance by one lineage over another.},

	abstract = {Mechanism-based chemical kinetic models are increasingly being used to describe biological signaling. Such models serve to encapsulate current understanding of pathways and to enable insight into complex biological processes. One challenge in model development is that, with limited experimental data, multiple models can be consistent with known mechanisms and existing data. Here, we address the problem of model ambiguity by providing a method for designing dynamic stimuli that, in stimulus-response experiments, distinguish among parameterized models with different topologies, i.e., reaction mechanisms, in which only some of the species can be measured. We develop the approach by presenting two formulations of a model-based controller that is used to design the dynamic stimulus. In both formulations, an input signal is designed for each candidate model and parameterization so as to drive the model outputs through a target trajectory. The quality of a model is then assessed by the ability of the corresponding controller, informed by that model, to drive the experimental system. We evaluated our method on models of antibody-ligand binding, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation, and larger models of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway. For each of these systems, the controller informed by the correct model is the most successful at designing a stimulus to produce the desired behavior. Using these stimuli we were able to distinguish between models with subtle mechanistic differences or where input and outputs were multiple reactions removed from the model differences. An advantage of this method of model discrimination is that it does not require novel reagents, or altered measurement techniques; the only change to the experiment is the time course of stimulation. Taken together, these results provide a strong basis for using designed input stimuli as a tool for the development of cell signaling models.},

While recent studies using single cell transcriptome analysis illustrate the power to measure and understand cellular heterogeneity in complex biological systems, processing large amounts of RNA-seq data from heterogeneous cell populations creates the need for readily accessible tools for the analysis of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) profiles. The present study presents a generally applicable analytic pipeline (SINCERA: a computational pipeline for SINgle CEll RNA-seq profiling Analysis) for processing scRNA-seq data from a whole organ or sorted cells. The pipeline supports the analysis for: 1) the distinction and identification of major cell types; 2) the identification of cell type specific gene signatures; and 3) the determination of driving forces of given cell types. We applied this pipeline to the RNA-seq analysis of single cells isolated from embryonic mouse lung at E16.5. Through the pipeline analysis, we distinguished major cell types of fetal mouse lung, including epithelial, endothelial, smooth muscle, pericyte, and fibroblast-like cell types, and identified cell type specific gene signatures, bioprocesses, and key regulators.

Here, we characterized patterns of sensitivity and resistance to three conventional chemotherapeutic agents with divergent mechanisms of action [gemcitabine, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and cisplatin] in pancreatic cancer cells. Four (L3.6pl, BxPC-3, CFPAC-1, and SU86.86) were sensitive and five (PANC-1, Hs766T, AsPC-1, MIAPaCa-2, and MPanc96) were resistant to all three agents based on GI(50) (50\% growth inhibition). Gene expression profiling and unsupervised hierarchical clustering revealed that the sensitive and resistant cells formed two distinct groups and differed in expression of specific genes, including several features of "epithelial to mesenchymal transition" (EMT). Interestingly, an inverse correlation between E-cadherin and its transcriptional suppressor, Zeb-1, was observed in the gene expression data and was confirmed by real-time PCR. Independent validation experiment using five new pancreatic cancer cell lines confirmed that an inverse correlation between E-cadherin and Zeb-1 correlated closely with resistance to gemcitabine, 5-FU, and cisplatin. Silencing Zeb-1 in the mesenchymal lines not only increased the expression of E-cadherin but also other epithelial markers, such as EVA1 and MAL2, and restored drug sensitivity. Importantly, immunohistochemical analysis of E-cadherin and Zeb-1 in primary tumors confirmed that expression of the two proteins was mutually exclusive (P = 0.012). Therefore, our results suggest that Zeb-1 and other regulators of EMT may maintain drug resistance in human pancreatic cancer cells, and therapeutic strategies to inhibit Zeb-1 and reverse EMT should be evaluated.},

	abstract = {Rhythms with time scales of multiple cycles per second permeate the mammalian brain, yet neuroscientists are not certain of their functional roles. One leading idea is that coherent oscillation between two brain regions facilitates the exchange of information between them. In rats, the hippocampus and the vibrissal sensorimotor system both are characterized by rhythmic oscillation in the theta range, 5-12 Hz. Previous work has been divided as to whether the two rhythms are independent or coherent. To resolve this question, we acquired three measures from rats-whisker motion, hippocampal local field potential (LFP), and barrel cortex unit firing-during a whisker-mediated texture discrimination task and during control conditions (not engaged in a whisker-mediated memory task). Compared to control conditions, the theta band of hippocampal LFP showed a marked increase in power as the rats approached and then palpated the texture. Phase synchronization between whisking and hippocampal LFP increased by almost 50\% during approach and texture palpation. In addition, a greater proportion of barrel cortex neurons showed firing that was phase-locked to hippocampal theta while rats were engaged in the discrimination task. Consistent with a behavioral consequence of phase synchronization, the rats identified the texture more rapidly and with lower error likelihood on trials in which there was an increase in theta-whisking coherence at the moment of texture palpation. These results suggest that coherence between the whisking rhythm, barrel cortex firing, and hippocampal LFP is augmented selectively during epochs in which the rat collects sensory information and that such coherence enhances the efficiency of integration of stimulus information into memory and decision-making centers.},

If an abnormal variation is present in more than 25\&\#37; of the final cells, a monoclonal, leukemic pattern occurs. Such a pattern develops if: (A1) The abnormal variation occurs early, during the first or second divisions; (A2) The variation confers exceptional proliferative capacity; (B) A sizable proportion of the normal clones are destroyed and a previously non-significant abnormal clone gains relative dominance over a depleted environment; (C) The abnormal variation confers relative \&\#x2018;immortality\&\#x2019;, rendering it significant during the contraction phase. Combinations of these pathways further enhance the leukemic risk of the system. A simple mathematical model is used in order to characterize normal and leukemic states and to explain the above cellular processes generating monoclonal leukemic patterns.},

	abstract = {Some bacteria, such as Bacillus subtilis, form spores when starved of food, which enables them to lie dormant for years and wait for conditions to improve. To make a spore, the bacterial cell divides to make a larger mother cell and a smaller forespore cell. Then the membrane that surrounds the mother cell moves to surround the forespore and engulf it. For this process to take place, a rigid mesh-like layer called the cell wall, which lies outside the cell membrane, needs to be remodelled. This happens once a partition in the cell wall, called a septum, has formed, separating mother and daughter cells. However, it is not clear how the mother cell can generate the physical force required to engulf the forespore under the cramped conditions imposed by the cell wall. To address this question, Ojkic, López-Garrido et al. used microscopy to investigate how B. subtilis makes spores. The experiments show that, in order to engulf the forespore, the mother cell must produce new cell wall and destroy cell wall that is no longer needed. Running a simple biophysical model on a computer showed that coordinating these two processes could generate enough force for a mother cell to engulf a forespore. Ojkic, López-Garrido et al. propose that the junction between the septum and the cell wall moves around the forespore to make room for the mother cell’s membrane for expansion. Other spore-forming bacteria that threaten human health – such as Clostridium difficile, which causes bowel infections, and Bacillus anthracis, which causes anthrax – might form their spores in the same way, but this remains to be tested. More work will also be needed to understand exactly how bacterial cells coordinate the cell wall synthesis and cell wall degradation.},

	abstract = {Conventional methods for profiling the molecular content of biological samples fail to resolve heterogeneity that is present at the level of single cells. In the past few years, single cell RNA sequencing has emerged as a powerful strategy for overcoming this challenge. However, its adoption has been limited by a paucity of methods that are at once simple to implement and cost effective to scale massively. Here, we describe a combinatorial indexing strategy to profile the transcriptomes of large numbers of single cells or single nuclei without requiring the physical isolation of each cell (Single cell Combinatorial Indexing RNA-seq or sci-RNA-seq). We show that sci-RNA-seq can be used to efficiently profile the transcriptomes of tens-of-thousands of single cells per experiment, and demonstrate that we can stratify cell types from these data. Key advantages of sci-RNA-seq over contemporary alternatives such as droplet-based single cell RNA-seq include sublinear cost scaling, a reliance on widely available reagents and equipment, the ability to concurrently process many samples within a single workflow, compatibility with methanol fixation of cells, cell capture based on DNA content rather than cell size, and the flexibility to profile either cells or nuclei. As a demonstration of sci-RNA-seq, we profile the transcriptomes of 42,035 single cells from C. elegans at the L2 stage, effectively 50-fold "shotgun cellular coverage" of the somatic cell composition of this organism at this stage. We identify 27 distinct cell types, including rare cell types such as the two distal tip cells of the developing gonad, estimate consensus expression profiles and define cell-type specific and selective genes. Given that C. elegans is the only organism with a fully mapped cellular lineage, these data represent a rich resource for future methods aimed at defining cell types and states. They will advance our understanding of developmental biology, and constitute a major leap towards a comprehensive, single-cell molecular atlas of a whole animal.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:The 2014 epidemic of Ebola virus disease in parts of west Africa defines an unprecedented health threat. We developed a model of Ebola virus transmission that integrates detailed geographical and demographic data from Liberia to overcome the limitations of non-spatial approaches in projecting the disease dynamics and assessing non-pharmaceutical control interventions. METHODS:We modelled the movements of individuals, including patients not infected with Ebola virus, seeking assistance in health-care facilities, the movements of individuals taking care of patients infected with Ebola virus not admitted to hospital, and the attendance of funerals. Individuals were grouped into randomly assigned households (size based on Demographic Health Survey data) that were geographically placed to match population density estimates on a grid of 3157 cells covering the country. The spatial agent-based model was calibrated with a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. The model was used to estimate Ebola virus transmission parameters and investigate the effectiveness of interventions such as availability of Ebola treatment units, safe burials procedures, and household protection kits. FINDINGS:Up to Aug 16, 2014, we estimated that 38·3\% of infections (95\% CI 17·4-76·4) were acquired in hospitals, 30·7\% (14·1-46·4) in households, and 8·6\% (3·2-11·8) while participating in funerals. We noted that the movement and mixing, in hospitals at the early stage of the epidemic, of patients infected with Ebola virus and those not infected was a sufficient driver of the reported pattern of spatial spread. The subsequent decrease of incidence at country and county level is attributable to the increasing availability of Ebola treatment units (which in turn contributed to drastically decreased hospital transmission), safe burials, and distribution of household protection kits. INTERPRETATION:The model allows assessment of intervention options and the understanding of their role in the decrease in incidence reported since Sept 7, 2014. High-quality data (eg, to estimate household secondary attack rate, contact patterns within hospitals, and effects of ongoing interventions) are needed to reduce uncertainty in model estimates.

	abstract = {Understanding the relationship between robustness and evolvability is key to understand how living things can withstand mutations, while producing ample variation that leads to evolutionary innovations. Mutational robustness and evolvability, a system's ability to produce heritable variation, harbour a paradoxical tension. On one hand, high robustness implies low production of heritable phenotypic variation. On the other hand, both experimental and computational analyses of neutral networks indicate that robustness enhances evolvability. I here resolve this tension using RNA genotypes and their secondary structure phenotypes as a study system. To resolve the tension, one must distinguish between robustness of a genotype and a phenotype. I confirm that genotype (sequence) robustness and evolvability share an antagonistic relationship. In stark contrast, phenotype (structure) robustness promotes structure evolvability. A consequence is that finite populations of sequences with a robust phenotype can access large amounts of phenotypic variation while spreading through a neutral network. Population-level processes and phenotypes rather than individual sequences are key to understand the relationship between robustness and evolvability. My observations may apply to other genetic systems where many connected genotypes produce the same phenotypes.},

	doi = {10.1186/jbiol20},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Dishevelled (Dsh) is a key component of multiple signaling pathways that are initiated by Wnt secreted ligands and Frizzled receptors during embryonic development. Although Dsh has been detected in a number of cellular compartments, the importance of its subcellular distribution for signaling remains to be determined. RESULTS:We report that Dsh protein accumulates in cell nuclei when Xenopus embryonic explants or mammalian cells are incubated with inhibitors of nuclear export or when a specific nuclear-export signal (NES) in Dsh is disrupted by mutagenesis. Dsh protein with a mutated NES, while predominantly nuclear, remains fully active in its ability to stimulate canonical Wnt signaling. Conversely, point mutations in conserved amino-acid residues that are essential for the nuclear localization of Dsh impair the ability of Dsh to activate downstream targets of Wnt signaling. When these conserved residues of Dsh are replaced with an unrelated SV40 nuclear localization signal, full Dsh activity is restored. Consistent with a signaling function for Dsh in the nucleus, treatment of cultured mammalian cells with medium containing Wnt3a results in nuclear accumulation of endogenous Dsh protein. CONCLUSIONS:These findings suggest that nuclear localization of Dsh is required for its function in the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. We discuss the relevance of these findings to existing models of Wnt signal transduction to the nucleus.},

	abstract = {The global financial crisis of 2007-2009 exposed critical weaknesses in the financial system. Many proposals for financial reform address the need for systemic regulation–that is, regulation focused on the soundness of the whole financial system and not just that of individual institutions. In this paper, we study one particular problem faced by a systemic regulator: the tension between the distribution of assets that individual banks would like to hold and the distribution across banks that best supports system stability if greater weight is given to avoiding multiple bank failures. By diversifying its risks, a bank lowers its own probability of failure. However, if many banks diversify their risks in similar ways, then the probability of multiple failures can increase. As more banks fail simultaneously, the economic disruption tends to increase disproportionately. We show that, in model systems, the expected systemic cost of multiple failures can be largely explained by two global parameters of risk exposure and diversity, which can be assessed in terms of the risk exposures of individual actors. This observation hints at the possibility of regulatory intervention to promote systemic stability by incentivizing a more diverse diversification among banks. Such intervention offers the prospect of an additional lever in the armory of regulators, potentially allowing some combination of improved system stability and reduced need for additional capital.},

Second, the axial regionalization of the neural plate that will result in the specification of neurons with different anteroposterior identities. Although this description of the process applies with ease to amphibians and fish, it is more difficult to confirm in amniote embryos. Here, a specialized population of cells emerges at the end of gastrulation that, under the influence of Wnt and FGF signalling, expands and generates the spinal cord and the paraxial mesoderm. This population is known as the long-term neuromesodermal precursor (NMp). Here, we show that controlled increases of Wnt/$\beta$-catenin and FGF signalling during adherent culture differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) generates a population with many of the properties of the NMp. A single-cell analysis of gene expression within this population reveals signatures that are characteristic of stem cell populations. Furthermore, when this activation is triggered in three-dimensional aggregates of mESCs, the population self-organizes macroscopically and undergoes growth and axial elongation that mimics some of the features of the embryonic spinal cord and paraxial mesoderm. We use both adherent and three-dimensional cultures of mESCs to probe the establishment and maintenance of NMps and their differentiation.},

Asynchronous Boolean modelling of the network was used to compare simulation results with reported experimental observations. Such comparison highlighted the need to include additional regulatory connections in order to obtain the fixed point attractors of the model associated with the five known progenitor cell types located in the ventral spinal cord. The revised gene regulatory network reproduced previously observed cell state switches between progenitor cells observed in knock-out animal models or in experiments where the transcription factors were overexpressed. Furthermore the network predicted the inhibition of Irx3 by Nkx2.2 and this prediction was tested experimentally. Our results provide evidence for the existence of an as yet undescribed inhibitory connection which could potentially have significance beyond the ventral spinal cord.

	abstract = {Cancers are rarely caused by single mutations, but often develop as a result of the combined effects of multiple mutations. For most cells, the number of possible cell divisions is limited because of various biological constraints, such as progressive telomere shortening, cell senescence cascades or a hierarchically organized tissue structure. Thus, the risk of accumulating cells carrying multiple mutations is low. Nonetheless, many diseases are based on the accumulation of such multiple mutations. We model a general, hierarchically organized tissue by a multi-compartment approach, allowing any number of mutations within a cell. We derive closed solutions for the deterministic clonal dynamics and the reproductive capacity of single clones. Our results hold for the average dynamics in a hierarchical tissue characterized by an arbitrary combination of proliferation parameters. We show that hierarchically organized tissues strongly suppress cells carrying multiple mutations and derive closed solutions for the expected size and diversity of clonal populations founded by a single mutant within the hierarchy. We discuss the example of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in detail and find good agreement between our predicted results and recently observed clonal diversities in patients. This result can contribute to the explanation of very diverse mutation profiles observed by whole genome sequencing of many different cancers.},

Although myeloma initiating cells (MICs) are likely to share many properties of normal stem cells, the underlying mechanisms regulating the fate of MICs are largely unknown. Studies designed to explore such communication are urgently needed to enhance our ability to predict the fate decisions of ICs (self-renewal, differentiation, and proliferation). In this study, we developed a novel system to understand the intercellular communication between MICs and their niche by seamlessly integrating experimental data and mathematical model. We first designed dynamic cell culture experiments and collected three types of cells (side population cells, progenitor cells, and mature myeloma cells) under various cultural conditions with flow cytometry. Then we developed a lineage model with ordinary differential equations by considering secreted factors, self-renewal, differentiation, and other biological functions of those cells, to model the cell–cell interactions among the three cell types. Particle swarm optimization was employed to estimate the model parameters by fitting the experimental data to the lineage model. The theoretical results show that the correlation coefficient analysis can reflect the feedback loops among the three cell types, the intercellular feedback signaling can regulate cell population dynamics, and the culture strategies can decide cell growth. This study provides a basic framework of studying cell–cell interactions in regulating MICs fate.},

A model of macrophage loss following uptake of necrotic tissue is proposed to explain macrophage depletion following peak infection. Using Gaussian processes to approximate the computer code, we perform a sensitivity analysis to identify important parameters and to characterize their influence on the simulated infection. The analysis indicates that increasing growth rate can favor or suppress pathogen loads, depending on the infection stage and the pathogen's ability to avoid detection. Subsequent calibration of the model against previously published biological observations suggests that L. major has a relatively slow growth rate and can replicate for an extended period of time before damaging the host cell.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Despite decades of effort, little progress has been made to improve the treatment of cancer metastases. To leverage the central role of the mechanoenvironment in cancer metastasis, we present a mechanoresponsive cell system (MRCS) to selectively identify and treat cancer metastases by targeting the specific biophysical cues in the tumor niche in vivo. Our MRCS uses mechanosensitive promoter–driven mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)–based vectors, which selectively home to and target cancer metastases in response to specific mechanical cues to deliver therapeutics to effectively kill cancer cells, as demonstrated in a metastatic breast cancer mouse model. Our data suggest a strong correlation between collagen cross-linking and increased tissue stiffness at the metastatic sites, where our MRCS is specifically activated by the specific cancer–associated mechano-cues. MRCS has markedly reduced deleterious effects compared to MSCs constitutively expressing therapeutics. MRCS indicates that biophysical cues, specifically matrix stiffness, are appealing targets for cancer treatment due to their long persistence in the body (measured in years), making them refractory to the development of resistance to treatment. Our MRCS can serve as a platform for future diagnostics and therapies targeting aberrant tissue stiffness in conditions such as cancer and fibrotic diseases, and it should help to elucidate mechanobiology and reveal what cells “feel” in the microenvironment in vivo.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Transforming growth factor $\beta$ (TGF-$\beta$) signalling regulates the development of embryos and tissue homeostasis in adults. In conjunction with other oncogenic changes, long-term perturbation of TGF-$\beta$ signalling is associated with cancer metastasis. Although TGF-$\beta$ signalling can be complex, many of the signalling components are well defined, so it is possible to develop mathematical models of TGF-$\beta$ signalling using reduction and scaling methods. The parameterization of our TGF-$\beta$ signalling model is consistent with experimental data. We developed our mathematical model for the TGF-$\beta$ signalling pathway, i.e. the RF- model of TGF-$\beta$ signalling, using the “rapid equilibrium assumption” to reduce the network of TGF-$\beta$ signalling reactions based on the time scales of the individual reactions. By adding time-delayed positive feedback to the inherent time-delayed negative feedback for TGF-$\beta$ signalling. We were able to simulate the sigmoidal, switch-like behaviour observed for the concentration dependence of long-term ({\textgreater} 3 hours) TGF-$\beta$ stimulation. Computer simulations revealed the vital role of the coupling of the positive and negative feedback loops on the regulation of the TGF-$\beta$ signalling system. The incorporation of time-delays for the negative feedback loop improved the accuracy, stability and robustness of the model. This model reproduces both the short-term and long-term switching responses for the intracellular signalling pathways at different TGF-$\beta$ concentrations. We have tested the model against experimental data from MEF (mouse embryonic fibroblasts) WT, SV40-immortalized MEFs and Gp130 F/F MEFs. The predictions from the RF- model are consistent with the experimental data. Signalling feedback loops are required to model TGF-$\beta$ signal transduction and its effects on normal and cancer cells. We focus on the effects of time-delayed feedback loops and their coupling to ligand stimulation in this system. The model was simplified and reduced to its key components using standard methods and the rapid equilibrium assumption. We detected differences in short-term and long-term signal switching. The results from the RF- model compare well with experimental data and predict the dynamics of TGF-$\beta$ signalling in cancer cells with different mutations.},

In order to investigate the role of internal pressure on murine early lung development, we cauterized the tip of the trachea, to occlude it, and thus to increase internal pressure. This method allowed us to evaluate the effect of tracheal occlusion on the first few branch generations and on gene expression. We observed that the elevation of internal pressure induced more than a doubling in branching, associated with increased proliferation, while branch elongation speed increased 3-fold. Analysis by RT-PCR showed that Fgf10, Vegf, Sprouty2 and Shh mRNA expressions were affected by the change of intraluminal pressure after 48h of culture, suggesting mechanotransduction via internal pressure of these key developmental genes. Tracheal occlusion did not increase the number of branches of Fgfr2b-/- mice lungs nor of wild type lungs cultured with Fgfr2b antisense RNA. Tracheal occlusion of Fgf10(LacZ/-) hypomorphic lungs led to the formation of fewer branches than in wild type. We conclude that internal pressure regulates the FGF10-FGFR2b-Sprouty2 pathway and thus the speed of the branching process. Therefore pressure levels, fixed both by epithelial secretion and boundary conditions, can control or modulate the branching process via FGF10-FGFR2b-Sprouty2.},

Within contacts, Rac1 and lamellipodia transiently concentrate at newest sites, but decrease at older, stabilized sites. Significantly, Rac1 mutants alter kinetics of cell-cell adhesion and strengthening, but not the eventual generation of cell-cell contacts. Products of PI 3-kinase activity also accumulate dynamically at contacts, but are not essential for either initiation or development of cell-cell adhesion.

By applying SCUBA to analyze two complementary, publicly available datasets we successfully reconstructed the cellular hierarchy during early development of mouse embryos, modeled the dynamic changes in gene expression patterns, and predicted the effects of perturbing key transcriptional regulators on inducing lineage biases. The results were robust with respect to experimental platform differences between RT-PCR and RNA sequencing. We selectively tested our predictions in Nanog mutants and found good agreement between SCUBA predictions and the experimental data. We further extended the utility of SCUBA by developing a method to reconstruct missing temporal-order information from a typical single-cell dataset. Analysis of a hematopoietic dataset suggests that our method is effective for reconstructing gene expression dynamics during human B-cell development. In summary, SCUBA provides a useful single-cell data analysis tool that is well-suited for the investigation of developmental processes.},

Important biological examples of such systems include MAPK cascades and two-component systems which are well-studied experimentally as well as theoretically. The steady states of such a system are solutions to a system of polynomial equations. Even for small systems the task of finding the solutions is daunting. We develop a mathematical framework based on the notion of a cut (a particular subset of species in the system), which provides a linear elimination procedure to reduce the number of variables in the system to a set of core variables. The steady states are parameterized algebraically by the core variables, and graphical conditions for when steady states with positive core variables imply positivity of all variables are given. Further, minimal cuts are the connected components of the species graph and provide conservation laws. A criterion for when a (maximal) set of independent conservation laws can be derived from cuts is given.},

However, such modeling requires a large amount of quantitative data of signaling events with high spatio-temporal resolution. A novel technique which allows us to obtain such data is needed for systems biology of cellular signaling. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:We developed a fully automatable assay technique, termed quantitative image cytometry (QIC), which integrates a quantitative immunostaining technique and a high precision image-processing algorithm for cell identification. With the aid of an automated sample preparation system, this device can quantify protein expression, phosphorylation and localization with subcellular resolution at one-minute intervals. The signaling activities quantified by the assay system showed good correlation with, as well as comparable reproducibility to, western blot analysis. Taking advantage of the high spatio-temporal resolution, we investigated the signaling dynamics of the ERK pathway in PC12 cells. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:The QIC technique appears as a highly quantitative and versatile technique, which can be a convenient replacement for the most conventional techniques including western blot, flow cytometry and live cell imaging. Thus, the QIC technique can be a powerful tool for investigating the systems biology of cellular signaling.},

	abstract = {We propose a new method for approximate Bayesian statistical inference on the basis of summary statistics. The method is suited to complex problems that arise in population genetics, extending ideas developed in this setting by earlier authors. Properties of the posterior distribution of a parameter, such as its mean or density curve, are approximated without explicit likelihood calculations. This is achieved by fitting a local-linear regression of simulated parameter values on simulated summary statistics, and then substituting the observed summary statistics into the regression equation. The method combines many of the advantages of Bayesian statistical inference with the computational efficiency of methods based on summary statistics. A key advantage of the method is that the nuisance parameters are automatically integrated out in the simulation step, so that the large numbers of nuisance parameters that arise in population genetics problems can be handled without difficulty. Simulation results indicate computational and statistical efficiency that compares favorably with those of alternative methods previously proposed in the literature. We also compare the relative efficiency of inferences obtained using methods based on summary statistics with those obtained directly from the data using MCMC.},

Likewise, single-cell gene expression has been extensively studied for many cell types. However, how single cells use TSSs has not yet been examined. In particular, it is unknown whether alternative TSSs are independently expressed, or whether they are co-activated or even mutually exclusive in single cells. Here, we use a previously published single-cell RNA-seq dataset, comprising thousands of cells, to study alternative TSS usage. We find that alternative TSS usage is a regulated process, and the correlation between two TSSs expressed in single cells of the same cell type is surprisingly high. Our findings indicate that TSSs generally are regulated by common factors rather than being independently regulated or stochastically expressed. ![][1]{\textless}/img{\textgreater} Analyses of single-cell 5´ expression data across several thousands of mouse brain cells show that alternative transcription start sites (TSSs) are expressed at a fixed ratio in single cells with few exceptions.

These mechanisms ultimately determine the quantities of specific cell types that are generated. Despite their importance, the precise molecular interplays between cell cycle machinery and master regulators of cell fate choice remain to be fully uncovered. Here, we demonstrate that cell cycle regulators Cyclin D1-3 control cell fate decisions in human pluripotent stem cells by recruiting transcriptional corepressors and coactivator complexes onto neuroectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm genes. This activity results in blocking the core transcriptional network necessary for endoderm specification while promoting neuroectoderm factors. The genomic location of Cyclin Ds is determined by their interactions with the transcription factors SP1 and E2Fs, which result in the assembly of cell cycle-controlled transcriptional complexes. These results reveal how the cell cycle orchestrates transcriptional networks and epigenetic modifiers to instruct cell fate decisions.},

To adjust the X gene dosage between genders, female mouse preimplantation embryos undergo an imprinted form of X chromosome inactivation (iXCI) that requires both Rlim (also known as Rnf12) and the long non-coding RNA Xist. Moreover, it is thought that gene expression from the single active X is upregulated to correct for bi-allelic autosomal (A) gene expression. We have combined mouse genetics with RNA-seq on single mouse embryos to investigate functions of Rlim on the temporal regulation of iXCI and Xist. Our results reveal crucial roles of Rlim for the maintenance of high Xist RNA levels, Xist clouds and X-silencing in female embryos at blastocyst stages, while initial Xist expression appears Rlim-independent. We find further that X/A upregulation is initiated in early male and female preimplantation embryos.},

Some tumors undergo EMT while others do not, which may reflect intrinsic properties of their cell of origin. However, this possibility is largely unexplored. By targeting the same oncogenic mutations to discrete skin compartments, we show that cell-type-specific chromatin and transcriptional states differentially prime tumors to EMT. Squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) derived from interfollicular epidermis (IFE) are generally well differentiated, while hair follicle (HF) stem cell-derived SCCs frequently exhibit EMT, efficiently form secondary tumors, and possess increased metastatic potential. Transcriptional and epigenomic profiling revealed that IFE and HF tumor-initiating cells possess distinct chromatin landscapes and gene regulatory networks associated with tumorigenesis and EMT that correlate with accessibility of key epithelial and EMT transcription factor binding sites.

I will then point out the distinction between forward and reverse modeling and focus thereafter on the former. Instead of going into mathematical technicalities about different varieties of models, I will focus on their logical structure, in terms of assumptions and conclusions. A model is a logical machine for deducing the latter from the former. If the model is correct, then, if you believe its assumptions, you must, as a matter of logic, also believe its conclusions. This leads to consideration of the assumptions underlying models. If these are based on fundamental physical laws, then it may be reasonable to treat the model as 'predictive', in the sense that it is not subject to falsification and we can rely on its conclusions. However, at the molecular level, models are more often derived from phenomenology and guesswork. In this case, the model is a test of its assumptions and must be falsifiable. I will discuss three models from this perspective, each of which yields biological insights, and this will lead to some guidelines for prospective model builders.},

	abstract = {The bone marrow microenvironment (BMM) plays a critical role in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) maintenance and regulation. There is increasing interest in the role of the BMM in promoting leukemia stem cell (LSC) maintenance, resistance to conventional chemotherapy and targeted therapies, and ultimately disease relapse. Recent studies have enhanced our understanding of how the BMM regulates quiescence, self-renewal, and differentiation of LSC. In this comprehensive review, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of the crosstalk between the BMM and LSC, and the critical signaling pathways underlying these interactions. We also discuss potential approaches to exploit these observations to create novel strategies for targeting therapy-resistant LSC to achieve relapse-free survival in leukemic patients.},

	abstract = {Over the last 100 years, many studies have been performed to determine the biochemical and histopathological phenomena that mark the origin of neoplasms. At the end of the last century, the leading paradigm, which is currently well rooted, considered the origin of neoplasms to be a set of genetic and/or epigenetic mutations, stochastic and independent in a single cell, or rather, a stochastic monoclonal pattern. However, in the last 20 years, two important areas of research have underlined numerous limitations and incongruities of this pattern, the hypothesis of the so-called cancer stem cell theory and a revaluation of several alterations in metabolic networks that are typical of the neoplastic cell, the so-called Warburg effect. Even if this specific “metabolic sign” has been known for more than 85 years, only in the last few years has it been given more attention; therefore, the so-called Warburg hypothesis has been used in multiple and independent surveys. Based on an accurate analysis of a series of considerations and of biophysical thermodynamic events in the literature, we will demonstrate a homogeneous pattern of the cancer stem cell theory, of the Warburg hypothesis and of the stochastic monoclonal pattern; this pattern could contribute considerably as the first basis of the development of a new uniform theory on the origin of neoplasms. Thus, a new possible epistemological paradigm is represented; this paradigm considers the Warburg effect as a specific “metabolic sign” reflecting the stem origin of the neoplastic cell, where, in this specific metabolic order, an essential reason for the genetic instability that is intrinsic to the neoplastic cell is defined.},

The phenotypic variation found in organismal development is biased towards certain phenotypes, but the molecular mechanisms behind such restrictions are still poorly understood. Gene regulatory networks have been proposed as one cause of constrained phenotypic variation. However, most of the evidence for this is theoretical rather than experimental. Here, we study evolutionary biases in two synthetic gene regulatory circuits expressed in E. coli that produce a gene expression stripe; a pivotal pattern in embryonic development. The two parental circuits produce the same phenotype, but create it through different regulatory mechanisms. We show that mutations cause distinct novel phenotypes in the two networks and use a combination of experimental measurements, mathematical modelling and DNA sequencing to understand why mutations bring forth only some but not other novel gene expression phenotypes. Our results reveal that the regulatory mechanisms of networks restrict the possible phenotypic variation upon mutation. Consequently, seemingly equivalent networks can indeed be distinct in how they constrain the outcome of further evolution.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

It has recently been proposed that, rather than being a binary process, EMT occurs through distinct intermediate states. However, there is no direct in vivo evidence for this idea. Here we screen a large panel of cell surface markers in skin and mammary primary tumours, and identify the existence of multiple tumour subpopulations associated with different EMT stages: from epithelial to completely mesenchymal states, passing through intermediate hybrid states. Although all EMT subpopulations presented similar tumour-propagating cell capacity, they displayed differences in cellular plasticity, invasiveness and metastatic potential. Their transcriptional and epigenetic landscapes identify the underlying gene regulatory networks, transcription factors and signalling pathways that control these different EMT transition states. Finally, these tumour subpopulations are localized in different niches that differentially regulate EMT transition states.},

	abstract = {Pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) show heterogeneous expression levels of transcription factors (TFs) involved in pluripotency regulation, among them Nanog and Rex1. The expression of both TFs can change dynamically between states of high and low activity, correlating with the cells' capacity for self-renewal. Stochastic fluctuations as well as sustained oscillations in gene expression are possible mechanisms to explain this behaviour, but the lack of suitable data hampered their clear distinction. Here, we present a systems biology approach in which novel experimental data on TF heterogeneity is complemented by an agent-based model of mESC self-renewal. Because the model accounts for intracellular interactions, cell divisions and heredity structures, it allows for evaluating the consistency of the proposed mechanisms with data on population growth and on TF dynamics after cell sorting. Our model-based analysis revealed that a bistable, noise-driven network model fulfils the minimal requirements to consistently explain Nanog and Rex1 expression dynamics in heterogeneous and sorted mESC populations. Moreover, we studied the impact of TF-related proliferation capacities on the frequency of state transitions and demonstrate that cellular genealogies can provide insights into the heredity structures of mESCs.},

An imatinib treatment is also incorporated into the model. The simulations of the new PDE model are shown to qualitatively agree with the results that were obtained with the discrete-time (difference equation and agent-based) models.

It is usually characterized by an exponential growth in the number of parasite-infected erythrocytes, followed by marked oscillations in this number with a period of 48 h, which are eventually dampened. This course of events has been the subject of various mathematical models. In this paper we propose a new mathematical model for the in-host asexual erythrocytic development of P. falciparum malaria. Synchronicity of the infection is shown to be an inherent feature of infection, irrespective of the duration of merozoite release from the liver. It will, therefore, cause periodic symptoms, as known in malaria patients. We also simulate the effects of an induced host immune response and show how the level of immunity affects the development of disease. The simulations fit well with the clinical observations. We show how infection can become asynchronous and discuss the effect of desynchronization on the circulating and total parasitaemia and demonstrate that synchronized broods will show parasitaemia fluctuations.},

Instead, we propose that evolutionary birth-death processes, in which individuals give birth and die at ever-changing rates, should be the basis of evolutionary theory, because such processes capture the fundamental events that generate evolutionary dynamics. In evolutionary birth-death processes, fitness is at best a derived quantity, and owing to the potential complexity of such processes, there is no guarantee that there is a simple scalar, such as fitness, that would describe long-term evolutionary outcomes.

Taking the genetic regulatory network of NF\textit{κ}B as an exemplary system we explore the impact of having numerous distributed sites on the stochastic dynamics of oscillatory broadcasting genetic networks pointing out how resonances in binding cycles control the network9s specificity and performance.

Interactions during complete viral life cycles present unique opportunities to understand how host-parasite network take shape and behave. The Anticarsia gemmatalis multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AgMNPV) is a large double-stranded DNA virus, whose genome may encode for 152 open reading frames (ORFs). Here we present the analysis of the ordered cascade of the AgMNPV gene expression. We observed an earlier onset of the expression than previously reported for other baculoviruses, especially for genes involved in DNA replication. Most ORFs were expressed at higher levels in a more permissive host cell line. Genes with more than one copy in the genome had distinct expression profiles, which could indicate the acquisition of new functionalities. The transcription gene regulatory network (GRN) for 149 ORFs had a modular topology comprising five communities of highly interconnected nodes that separated key genes that are functionally related on different communities, possibly maximizing redundancy and GRN robustness by compartmentalization of important functions. Core conserved functions showed expression synchronicity, distinct GRN features and significantly less genetic diversity, consistent with evolutionary constraints imposed in key elements of biological systems. This reduced genetic diversity also had a positive correlation with the importance of the gene in our estimated GRN, supporting a relationship between phylogenetic data of baculovirus genes and network features inferred from expression data. We also observed that gene arrangement in overlapping transcripts was conserved among related baculoviruses, suggesting a principle of genome organization. Albeit with a reduced number of nodes (149), the AgMNPV GRN had a topology and key characteristics similar to those observed in complex cellular organisms, which indicates that modularity may be a general feature of biological gene regulatory networks.},

In most other cancers, the instability is observed at the chromosome level, resulting in losses and gains of whole chromosomes or large portions thereof.

	abstract = {Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) are a heterogeneous group of myeloid neoplasms with defects in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and possibly the HSPC niche. Here, we show that patient-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MDS MSCs) display a disturbed differentiation program and are essential for the propagation of MDS-initiating Lin(-)CD34(+)CD38(-) stem cells in orthotopic xenografts. Overproduction of niche factors such as CDH2 (N-Cadherin), IGFBP2, VEGFA, and LIF is associated with the ability of MDS MSCs to enhance MDS expansion. These factors represent putative therapeutic targets in order to disrupt critical hematopoietic-stromal interactions in MDS. Finally, healthy MSCs adopt MDS MSC-like molecular features when exposed to hematopoietic MDS cells, indicative of an instructive remodeling of the microenvironment. Therefore, this patient-derived xenograft model provides functional and molecular evidence that MDS is a complex disease that involves both the hematopoietic and stromal compartments. The resulting deregulated expression of niche factors may well also be a feature of other hematopoietic malignancies.},

During homeostasis, HSCs, and therefore putative bone-marrow HSC niches, are located near bone surfaces or are associated with the sinusoidal endothelium. The molecular crosstalk between HSCs and the cellular constituents of these niches is thought to control the balance between HSC self-renewal and differentiation, indicating that future successful expansion of HSCs for therapeutic use will require three-dimensional reconstruction of a stem-cell-niche unit.},

	abstract = {To study clonal evolution in myeloproliferative disorders, we used stochastic models of hematopoiesis for mouse and cat, species for which the in vivo kinetics of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have been experimentally defined. We determined the consequence if 1 HSC became able to survive without the support of a microenvironmental niche while the rest of its behavior did not change. Neoplastic cells persisted and dominated hematopoiesis in 14\% of mice and 17\% of cats, requiring mean times of 2.5 +/- 0.5 and 7.0 +/- 1.2 years, respectively (n=1000 simulations/species). In both species, when the number of neoplastic HSCs exceeded 0.5\% of all HSCs, clonal dominance was inevitable. Our results can explain the absence of clonal myeloproliferative disorders in mice (lifetime, 2 years), are consistent with clinical observations in cats, and provide insight into the progression of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in humans. They also demonstrate that competition for microenvironmental support can lead to the suppression of normal hematopoiesis as neoplasia evolves. Toxic or immunologic suppression of normal HSCs is not required.},

The fact that most anticancer therapy is directed against the bulk of the tumor, and possibly spares the cancer stem cells, may lie at the heart of treatment failures with conventional modalities. Leukemia stem cells are fairly well described for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but their existence and relevance for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is less clear. Several reports describe subpopulations with primitive phenotypes in clinical ALL samples. However, it has also been suggested that the majority of leukemic subfractions can propagate leukemia in the appropriate experimental setting, and that their hierarchical organization is less strict than in AML. In addition, it is uncertain whether cancer stem cells arise from malignant transformation of a tissue-specific stem cell, or from committed progenitors or differentiated cells that re-acquire a stem cell-like program. In common childhood ALL, current evidence points towards the cell of origin being a committed lymphoid progenitor. In this review, we highlight recent findings relating to the question of leukemia stem cells in ALL.},

	abstract = {Stem cell fate is influenced by specialized microenvironments that remain poorly defined in mammals. To explore the possibility that haematopoietic stem cells derive regulatory information from bone, accounting for the localization of haematopoiesis in bone marrow, we assessed mice that were genetically altered to produce osteoblast-specific, activated PTH/PTHrP receptors (PPRs). Here we show that PPR-stimulated osteoblastic cells that are increased in number produce high levels of the Notch ligand jagged 1 and support an increase in the number of haematopoietic stem cells with evidence of Notch1 activation in vivo. Furthermore, ligand-dependent activation of PPR with parathyroid hormone (PTH) increased the number of osteoblasts in stromal cultures, and augmented ex vivo primitive haematopoietic cell growth that was abrogated by gamma-secretase inhibition of Notch activation. An increase in the number of stem cells was observed in wild-type animals after PTH injection, and survival after bone marrow transplantation was markedly improved. Therefore, osteoblastic cells are a regulatory component of the haematopoietic stem cell niche in vivo that influences stem cell function through Notch activation. Niche constituent cells or signalling pathways provide pharmacological targets with therapeutic potential for stem-cell-based therapies.},

	abstract = {Phenotypic heterogeneity in cancers is associated with invasive progression and drug resistance. This heterogeneity arises in part from the ability of cancer cells to switch between phenotypic states, but the dynamics of this cellular plasticity remain poorly understood. Here we apply DNA barcodes to quantify and track phenotypic plasticity across hundreds of clones in a population of cancer cells exhibiting epithelial or mesenchymal differentiation phenotypes. We find that the epithelial-to-mesenchymal cell ratio is highly variable across the different clones in cancer cell populations, but remains stable for many generations within the progeny of any single clone—with a heritability of 0.89. To estimate the effects of combination therapies on phenotypically heterogeneous tumours, we generated quantitative simulations incorporating empirical data from our barcoding experiments. These analyses indicated that combination therapies which alternate between epithelial- and mesenchymal-specific treatments eventually select for clones with increased phenotypic plasticity. However, this selection could be minimized by increasing the frequency of alternation between treatments, identifying designs that may minimize selection for increased phenotypic plasticity. These findings establish new insights into phenotypic plasticity in cancer, and suggest design principles for optimizing the effectiveness of combination therapies for phenotypically heterogeneous tumours.},

	abstract = {Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are responsible for maintaining immune cells, red blood cells and platelets throughout life. HSCs must be located in their ecological niche (the bone marrow) to function correctly, that is, to regenerate themselves and their progeny; the latter eventually exit the bone marrow and enter circulation. We propose that cells with oncogenic potential—cancer/leukaemia stem cells (LSC)—and their progeny will also occupy this niche. Mathematical models, which describe the dynamics of HSCs, LSCs and their progeny allow investigation into the conditions necessary for defeating a malignant invasion of the niche. Two such models are developed and analysed here. To characterize their behaviour, we use an inferential framework that allows us to study regions in parameter space that give rise to desired behaviour together with an assessment of the robustness of the dynamics. Using this approach, we map out conditions under which HSCs can outcompete LSCs. In therapeutic applications, we clearly want to drive haematopoiesis into such regimes and the current analysis provide some guidance as to how we can identify new therapeutic targets. Our results suggest that maintaining a viable population of HSCs and their progenies in the niche may often already be nearly sufficient to eradicate LSCs from the system.},

We combine a simulation-based model of collective cell spreading with a novel Bayesian computational algorithm to estimate these parameters from carefully chosen summaries of collective cell image data and to quantify their associated uncertainty across different experimental conditions. Our summarisation of the image data leads to precise estimates for all parameters. Our analysis reveals that the cell diffusivity and the cell-to-cell adhesion strength estimates depend on experimental elapsed time. Furthermore, the cell-to-cell adhesion strength estimate appears to depend on the initial cell density, whereas the cell proliferation rate estimate is approximately the same over different experimental conditions.},

The aim of our study was to investigate whether HPV antibodies are associated with head and neck cancer risk when measured in prediagnostic sera. METHODS:We identified 638 participants with incident head and neck cancers (patients; 180 oral cancers, 135 oropharynx cancers, and 247 hypopharynx/larynx cancers) and 300 patients with esophageal cancers as well as 1,599 comparable controls from within the European Prospective Investigation Into Cancer and Nutrition cohort. Prediagnostic plasma samples from patients (collected, on average, 6 years before diagnosis) and control participants were analyzed for antibodies against multiple proteins of HPV16 as well as HPV6, HPV11, HPV18, HPV31, HPV33, HPV45, and HPV52. Odds ratios (ORs) of cancer and 95\% CIs were calculated, adjusting for potential confounders. All-cause mortality was evaluated among patients using Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS:HPV16 E6 seropositivity was present in prediagnostic samples for 34.8\% of patients with oropharyngeal cancer and 0.6\% of controls (OR, 274; 95\% CI, 110 to 681) but was not associated with other cancer sites. The increased risk of oropharyngeal cancer among HPV16 E6 seropositive participants was independent of time between blood collection and diagnosis and was observed more than 10 years before diagnosis. The all-cause mortality ratio among patients with oropharyngeal cancer was 0.30 (95\% CI, 0.13 to 0.67), for patients who were HPV16 E6 seropositive compared with seronegative. CONCLUSION:HPV16 E6 seropositivity was present more than 10 years before diagnosis of oropharyngeal cancers.},

Our results unequivocally demonstrate that stochastic effects related to the finite size of the active stem cell population have a profound influence on the dynamics of cancer evolution. For input parameters compatible with both the natural history of human cancer and mouse models, our results show how stochastic dynamics alone may lead to both remission in some cases and rapid expansion in others.},

	abstract = {Motivation:cis-regulatory DNA sequence elements, such as enhancers and silencers, function to control the spatial and temporal expression of their target genes. Although the overall levels of gene expression in large cell populations seem to be precisely controlled, transcription of individual genes in single cells is extremely variable in real time. It is, therefore, important to understand how these cis-regulatory elements function to dynamically control transcription at single-cell resolution. Recently, statistical methods have been proposed to back calculate the rates involved in mRNA transcription using parameter estimation of a mathematical model of transcription and translation. However, a major complication in these approaches is that some of the parameters, particularly those corresponding to the gene copy number and transcription rate, cannot be distinguished; therefore, these methods cannot be used when the copy number is unknown.Results: Here, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian model to estimate biokinetic parameters from live cell enhancer–promoter reporter measurements performed on a population of single cells. This allows us to investigate transcriptional dynamics when the copy number is variable across the population. We validate our method using synthetic data and then apply it to quantify the function of two known developmental enhancers in real time and in single cells.Availability: Supporting information is submitted with the article.Contact:d.j.woodcock@warwick.ac.ukSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {It is common knowledge that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a critical regulator of mesenchymal cell migration and proliferation. Nevertheless, these two cellular responses are mutually exclusive. To solve this apparent contradiction, we studied the behavior of NIH3T3 fibroblasts in response to increasing concentrations of PDGF. We found that there is strong cell proliferation induction only with PDGF concentrations {\textgreater}5 ng/ml, whereas the cell migration response arises starting from 1 ng/ml and is negligible at higher PDGF concentrations. According to these phenotypic evidences, our data indicate that cells display a differential activation of the main signaling pathways in response to PDGF as a function of the stimulation dose. At low PDGF concentrations, there is maximal activation of signaling pathways linked to cytoskeleton rearrangement needed for cell motility, whereas high PDGF concentrations activate pathways linked to mitogenesis induction. Our results suggest a mechanism by which cells switch from a migrating to a proliferating phenotype sensing the increasing gradient of PDGF. In addition, we propose that the cell decision to proliferate or migrate relies on different endocytotic routes of the PDGF receptor in response to different PDGF concentrations.},

However, why MYOD can efficiently convert some cell types into myotubes but not others remains poorly understood. Here, we analyze MYOD-mediated reprogramming of human fibroblasts at pseudotemporal resolution using single-cell RNA-Seq. Successfully reprogrammed cells navigate a trajectory with two branches that correspond to two barriers to reprogramming, with cells that select incorrect branches terminating at aberrant or incomplete reprogramming outcomes. Differential analysis of the major branch points alongside alignment of the successful reprogramming path to a primary myoblast trajectory revealed Insulin and BMP signaling as crucial molecular determinants of an individual cell's reprogramming outcome, that when appropriately modulated, increased efficiency more than five-fold. Our single-cell analysis reveals that MYOD is sufficient to reprogram cells only when the extracellular milieu is favorable, supporting MYOD with upstream signaling pathways that drive normal myogenesis in development.},

In many of these systems, the role of heterogeneity has risen to prominence as a determinant of cell type composition and lineage transitions. While much effort has gone into developing appropriate tools for the analysis and comprehension of single cell sequencing data, further advances are required. Optimization-based approaches are under-utilized in single cell analysis and hold much potential due to their ability to capture global properties of the system in low dimension. Here we present SoptSC: an optimization-based algorithm for the identification of subpopulation structure, transition paths, and pseudotemporal ordering within a cell population. Based on a measure of similarity between cells, SoptSC uses non-negative matrix factorization to create low dimensional representations of the data for analysis and visualization. We find that in several examples, the low-dimensional representations produced by SoptSC offer greater potential for insight than alternative methods. We tested our methods on a simulated dataset and four published single cell datasets from Homo sapiens and Mus musculus. SoptSC is able to recapitulate a simulated developmental trajectory with greater fidelity than com- parable methods. Applied to two datasets on early embryonic development, SoptSC recapitulates known trajectories with high accuracy. Analysis of murine epidermis reveals overall agreement with previous studies, but differs markedly regarding the composition and heterogeneity of the basal compartment. Analysis of murine myelopoiesis found that SoptSC can resolve complex hematopoietic subpopulation composition, and led to a new prediction regarding the asynchronous development of myeloid subpopulations during stem cell differentiation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In Hoxb7/myr-Venus mice, the outlines of all Wolffian duct and ureteric bud epithelial cells are strongly labeled at all stages of urogenital development, allowing the shapes and arrangements of individual cells to be readily observed by confocal microscopy of freshly excised or cultured kidneys. This strain should be extremely useful for studies of cell behavior during ureteric bud branching morphogenesis in wild type and mutant mouse lines.},

	abstract = {Cell-intrinsic metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer that provides anabolic support to cell proliferation. How reprogramming influences tumor heterogeneity or drug sensitivities is not well understood. Here, we report a self-organizing spatial pattern of glycolysis in xenograft colon tumors where pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK1), a negative regulator of oxidative phosphorylation, is highly active in clusters of cells arranged in a spotted array. To understand this pattern, we developed a reaction–diffusion model that incorporates Wnt signaling, a pathway known to upregulate PDK1 and Warburg metabolism. Partial interference with Wnt alters the size and intensity of the spotted pattern in tumors and in the model. The model predicts that Wnt inhibition should trigger an increase in proteins that enhance the range of Wnt ligand diffusion. Not only was this prediction validated in xenograft tumors but similar patterns also emerge in radiochemotherapy-treated colorectal cancer. The model also predicts that inhibitors that target glycolysis or Wnt signaling in combination should synergize and be more effective than each treatment individually. We validated this prediction in 3D colon tumor spheroids.

	abstract = {Author Summary The small intestinal epithelium, like our skin, is constantly being renewed. In the intestine however, this epithelium is exposed to the harsh digestive environment, necessitating much more rapid renewal. Remarkably, the entire epithelium is renewed every 4–5 days. This raises the question, how can the size and structure of this tissue be maintained given this pace. Motivated by recent experimental observations, we construct a three-dimensional, hybrid stochastic model to investigate the mechanisms responsible for homeostasis of this tissue. We find that there are redundant signals created by both the epithelium itself and surrounding tissues that act in parallel to maintain epithelial structure. This redundancy comes at a price however: it introduces the possibility of explosive stem cell population growth. Additional results suggest that other signals along with choreographed motion of cells are responsible for repressing this expansion. Taken together, our results provide a novel hypothesis for how robust but fast renewal of the crypt is achieved: as a balance between expansion, which drives fast renewal and repression, which holds that expansion in check to maintain the crypt’s structure.},

	abstract = {Cells in an animal’s body must communicate with one another to coordinate many processes that are essential to life. One way that cells do this is by releasing molecules that bind to receptors located on the surface of others cells; this binding then triggers a signaling pathway in the receiving cell that passes information from the surface of the cell to its interior. The last stage of these pathways typically involves specific genes being activated, which changes the cell’s overall activity. Wnt is one protein that animal cells release to control how nearby cells grow and divide. One arm of the Wnt signaling pathway involves a protein called $\beta$-catenin. In the absence of a Wnt signal, there is little $\beta$-catenin in the cell. When Wnt binds to its receptor, $\beta$-catenin accumulates and enters the cell’s nucleus to activate its target genes. One of these genes, called cyclin D1, controls cell division. However it was not understood how $\beta$-catenin builds up in response to a Wnt signal and influences the activity of genes. Using microscopy, Kafri et al. have now examined how the activities of $\beta$-catenin and the cyclin D1 gene change in living human cells. These analyses were initially performed in a population of cells, and confirmed that $\beta$-catenin rapidly accumulates after a Wnt signal and that the cyclin D1 gene becomes activated. Individual cells in a population can respond differently to signaling events. To assess whether human cells differ in their responses to Wnt, Kafri et al. examined the dynamics of $\beta$-catenin in single cells in real time. In most cells, $\beta$-catenin accumulated after Wnt activation. However, the time taken to accumulate $\beta$-catenin, and this protein’s levels, varied between individual cells. Most cells showed the “average” response, with one major wave of accumulation that peaked about two hours after the Wnt signal. Notably, in some cells, $\beta$-catenin accumulated in the cell’s nucleus in two waves; in other words, the levels in this compartment of the cell increased, dropped slightly and then increased again. So how does $\beta$-catenin in the nucleus activate target genes? Kafri et al. saw that the absolute number of $\beta$-catenin molecules in the nucleus did not affect the activity of cyclin D1. Instead, cells appeared to sense how quickly the amount of $\beta$-catenin in the nucleus changes over time, and this rate influences the activation of cyclin D1. Importantly, problems with Wnt signaling have been linked to diseases in humans; and different components of the Wnt signaling pathway are mutated in many cancers. An important next challenge will be to uncover how the dynamics of this pathway change during disease. Furthermore, a better understanding of Wnt signaling may in future help efforts to develop new drugs that can target the altered pathway in cancer cells.},

This observation has long been attributed to the presence of bacterial populations in the host that are "drug-tolerant" because of their slow replication and low rate of metabolism. However, both the physiologic state of these hypothetical drug-tolerant populations and the bacterial pathways that regulate growth and metabolism in vivo remain obscure. Here we demonstrate that diverse growth-limiting stresses trigger a common signal transduction pathway in Mycobacterium tuberculosis that leads to the induction of triglyceride synthesis. This pathway plays a causal role in reducing growth and antibiotic efficacy by redirecting cellular carbon fluxes away from the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Mutants in which this metabolic switch is disrupted are unable to arrest their growth in response to stress and remain sensitive to antibiotics during infection. Thus, this regulatory pathway contributes to antibiotic tolerance in vivo, and its modulation may represent a novel strategy for accelerating TB treatment.},

We now present arguments as to why the theoretical arguments for ABC model choice are missing, because the algorithm involves an unknown loss of information induced by the use of insufficient summary statistics. The approximation error of the posterior probabilities of the models under comparison may thus be unrelated with the computational effort spent in running an ABC algorithm. We then conclude that additional empirical verifications of the performances of the ABC procedure as those available in DIY-ABC are necessary to conduct model choice.},

We also show that this lineage conversion is associated with an activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in aged myogenic progenitors and can be suppressed by Wnt inhibitors. Furthermore, components of serum from aged mice that bind to the Frizzled family of proteins, which are Wnt receptors, may account for the elevated Wnt signaling in aged cells.

We show that this mechanism applies in particular to bacterial chemotaxis. This is demonstrated within a quantitative model which explains, in a unified way, many aspects of chemotaxis, including proper responses to chemical gradients. The adaptation property is a consequence of the network's connectivity and does not require the 'fine-tuning' of parameters.

	abstract = {Bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are responsible for both lifelong daily maintenance of all blood cells and for repair after cell loss. Until recently the cellular mechanisms by which HSCs accomplish these two very different tasks remained an open question. Biological evidence has now been found for the existence of two related mouse HSC populations. First, a dormant HSC (d-HSC) population which harbors the highest self-renewal potential of all blood cells but is only induced into active self-renewal in response to hematopoietic stress. And second, an active HSC (a-HSC) subset that by and large produces the progenitors and mature cells required for maintenance of day-to-day hematopoiesis. Here we present computational analyses further supporting the d-HSC concept through extensive modeling of experimental DNA label-retaining cell (LRC) data. Our conclusion that the presence of a slowly dividing subpopulation of HSCs is the most likely explanation (amongst the various possible causes including stochastic cellular variation) of the observed long term Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) retention, is confirmed by the deterministic and stochastic models presented here. Moreover, modeling both HSC BrdU uptake and dilution in three stages and careful treatment of the BrdU detection sensitivity permitted improved estimates of HSC turnover rates. This analysis predicts that d-HSCs cycle about once every 149–193 days and a-HSCs about once every 28–36 days. We further predict that, using LRC assays, a 75\%–92.5\% purification of d-HSCs can be achieved after 59–130 days of chase. Interestingly, the d-HSC proportion is now estimated to be around 30–45\% of total HSCs - more than twice that of our previous estimate.},

	abstract = {A single tumor can be made up of thousands of cancer cells that look and behave differently from one another. This observed diversity arises from changes in the DNA sequence of particular genes, changes in the activity of genes, and the ability of cells to transition between different states. As a result, individual cells within a tumor may react differently to certain anti-cancer drugs: most of the cells may be sensitive to the treatment and die, whereas some might be resistant and survive. Previous studies on several types of human cancers – including breast, brain and lung cancers – have identified a group of cells called CD44+/CD24- cells that seem to be more aggressive and resistant to therapy than other cancer cells. However, it is currently not known exactly how these CD44+/CD24- cells influence a whole tumor’s resistance to anti-cancer drugs. Certain cancer cells in tumors are exposed to a signal molecule called TGF-$\beta$. CD44+/CD24- cells are unusual in that they are able to produce and release this signal molecule themselves. Pal et al. show that in CD44+/CD24- cells from a human lung cancer cell line, TGF-$\beta$ decreased the activity of genes responsible for accurately fixing breaks in the CD44+/CD24- cells’ DNA. As a result, these cells made more mistakes than other lung cancer cells when repairing damaged DNA and consequently accumulated additional genetic mutations. Furthermore, tumors containing these cells were more likely to survive treatment with chemotherapy. The findings of Pal et al. show that the CD44+/CD24- cells exposed to TGF-$\beta$ had a survival advantage because they were more genetically diverse and therefore better able to adapt to new drug treatments and other changes in their surroundings. Future experiments may explore how to specifically target and kill the CD44+/CD24- cells from tumors.},

	abstract = {In 2016, malaria caused an estimated 216 million illnesses and 445,000 confirmed deaths globally. The disease is caused by a parasite, and mosquitos infected with the parasite transmit them to humans when they bite. In humans, the parasites enter the body and head to the liver before spending part of their life cycle in red blood cells, which cause the symptoms of the disease. Prevention efforts have reduced the burden of malaria but eliminating the disease will require new tools. One option is to use vaccines. The world’s first malaria vaccine – a so-called pre-erythrocytic vaccine (PEV) – targets the stages preceding the parasite reaching the liver. This vaccine prevents malaria parasites from infecting people, but it is only partially effective. Scientists are also developing transmission-blocking vaccines (TBVs). These TBVs block the development of malaria parasites in mosquitos that bite vaccinated humans. So far, the most promising TBV candidates are also only partly effective. It is possible that using PEV and TBV vaccines together could boost their effectiveness, since the TBV vaccines reduce the number of parasites that infect each mosquito. This means that fewer parasites are injected into the next person. Currently, the PEVs work better when there are fewer parasites infecting a person. Now, Sherrard-Smith et al. show that combining TBVs with PEVs enhances their antimalarial effects. In the experiments, Sherrard-Smith et al. treated mice with either TBV or PEV vaccines, or both. Then, the mice were exposed to mosquitos infected with the malaria parasite. As expected, the TBV and PEV treatments were only partially effective when used alone. But exposing the mice to both TBVs and PEVs eliminated the parasites from the mosquitos and the mice. The combined benefit of TBVs and PEVs were greater than would be expected if either vaccine was acting alone and the effects were simply multiplied, suggesting they enhance each other’s effects. More studies of TBVs in humans are needed to prove they are safe and effective in the real world. More studies also are needed to confirm what Sherrard-Smith et al. found in mice would happen in humans treated with a combination of TBV and PEV vaccines. But if such future studies prove this combination approach is effective, it could be a powerful tool in the fight against malaria.},

In vivo, SCF also synergizes with other growth factors and has been shown to enhance the mobilization of peripheral blood progenitor cells in combination with G-CSF. In phase I/II clinical studies administration of the combination of SCF and G-CSF resulted in a two- to threefold increase in cells that express the CD34 antigen compared with G-CSF alone.

Here, we introduce a mathematical modeling platform, PopAlign, that automatically identifies subpopulations of cells within a heterogeneous mixture, and tracks gene expression and cell abundance changes across subpopulations by constructing and comparing probabilistic models. We apply PopAlign to discover specific categories of signaling responses within primary human immune cells as well as patient-specific disease signatures in multiple myeloma that are obscured by techniques like tSNE.

Here, we show Flamingo (Fmi) and Frizzled (Fz) 8, members of noncanonical Wnt signaling, both express in and functionally maintain quiescent long-term HSCs. Fmi regulates Fz8 distribution at the interface between HSCs and N-cadherin(+) osteoblasts (N-cad(+)OBs that enrich osteoprogenitors) in the niche. We further found that N-cad(+)OBs predominantly express noncanonical Wnt ligands and inhibitors of canonical Wnt signaling under homeostasis. Under stress, noncanonical Wnt signaling is attenuated and canonical Wnt signaling is enhanced in activation of HSCs. Mechanistically, noncanonical Wnt signaling mediated by Fz8 suppresses the Ca(2+)-NFAT- IFNγ pathway, directly or indirectly through the CDC42-CK1α complex and also antagonizes canonical Wnt signaling in HSCs. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that noncanonical Wnt signaling maintains quiescent long-term HSCs through Fmi and Fz8 interaction in the niche.},

	abstract = {The Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi) ibrutinib is a new targeted therapy for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Ibrutinib is given orally on a continuous schedule and induces durable remissions in the majority of CLL patients. However, a small proportion of patients initially responds to the BTKi and then develops resistance. Estimating the frequency, timing, and individual risk of developing resistance to ibrutinib, therefore, would be valuable for long-term management of patients. Computational evolutionary models, based on measured kinetic parameters of patients, allow us to approach these questions and to develop a roadmap for personalized prognosis and treatment management. Our kinetic models predict that BTKi-resistant mutants exist before initiation of ibrutinib therapy, although they only comprise a minority of the overall tumor burden. Furthermore, we can estimate the time required for resistant cells to grow to detectable levels. We predict that this can be highly variable, depending mostly on growth and death rates of the individual CLL cell clone. For a specific patient, this time can be predicted with a high degree of certainty. Our model can thus be used to predict for how long ibrutinib can suppress the disease in individual patients. Furthermore, the model can suggest whether prior debulking of the tumor with chemo-immunotherapy can prolong progression-free survival under ibrutinib. Finally, by applying the models to data that document progression during ibrutinib therapy, we estimated that resistant mutants might have a small ({\textless}2\%) mean fitness advantage in the absence of treatment, compared with sensitive cells.},

	abstract = {Gene expression is a stochastic, or "noisy," process. This noise comes about in two ways. The inherent stochasticity of biochemical processes such as transcription and translation generates "intrinsic" noise. In addition, fluctuations in the amounts or states of other cellular components lead indirectly to variation in the expression of a particular gene and thus represent "extrinsic" noise. Here, we show how the total variation in the level of expression of a given gene can be decomposed into its intrinsic and extrinsic components. We demonstrate theoretically that simultaneous measurement of two identical genes per cell enables discrimination of these two types of noise. Analytic expressions for intrinsic noise are given for a model that involves all the major steps in transcription and translation. These expressions give the sensitivity to various parameters, quantify the deviation from Poisson statistics, and provide a way of fitting experiment. Transcription dominates the intrinsic noise when the average number of proteins made per mRNA transcript is greater than approximately 2. Below this number, translational effects also become important. Gene replication and cell division, included in the model, cause protein numbers to tend to a limit cycle. We calculate a general form for the extrinsic noise and illustrate it with the particular case of a single fluctuating extrinsic variable-a repressor protein, which acts on the gene of interest. All results are confirmed by stochastic simulation using plausible parameters for Escherichia coli.},

The underlying regulatory logic among network components was then learned using the initial network topology and single cell gene expression measurements from mESCs cultured in serum/LIF or serum-free 2i/LIF conditions. Comparing the learned network regulatory logic derived from cells cultured in serum/LIF vs. 2i/LIF revealed differential roles for Nanog, Oct4/Pou5f1, Sox2, Esrrb and Tcf3. Overall, gene expression in the serum/LIF condition was more variable than in the 2i/LIF but mostly consistent across the two conditions. Expression levels for most genes in single cells were bimodal across the entire population and this motivated a Boolean modeling approach. In silico predictions derived from removal of nodes from the Boolean dynamical model were validated with experimental single and combinatorial RNA interference (RNAi) knockdowns of selected network components. Quantitative post-RNAi expression level measurements of remaining network components showed good agreement with the in silico predictions. Computational removal of nodes from the Boolean network model was also used to predict lineage specification outcomes. In summary, data integration, modeling, and targeted experiments were used to improve our understanding of the regulatory topology that controls mESC fate decisions as well as to develop robust directed lineage specification protocols.},

Nature also makes extensive use of pressurized elastic capsules: plant cells, bacteria and fungi have stiff walls, which are subject to an internal turgor pressure. Here, we present theoretical, numerical and experimental investigations of the indentation of a linearly elastic shell subject to a constant internal pressure. We show that, unlike unpressurized shells, the relationship between force and displacement demonstrates two linear regimes. We determine analytical expressions for the effective stiffness in each of these regimes in terms of the material properties of the shell and the pressure difference. As a consequence, a single indentation experiment over a range of displacements may be used as a simple assay to determine both the internal pressure and elastic properties of capsules. Our results are relevant for determining the internal pressure in bacterial, fungal or plant cells. As an illustration of this, we apply our results to recent measurements of the stiffness of baker's yeast and infer from these experiments that the internal osmotic pressure of yeast cells may be regulated in response to changes in the osmotic pressure of the external medium.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE:Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been hypothesized to initiate and drive tumor growth and recurrence due to their self-renewal ability. If correct, this hypothesis implies that successful therapy must focus primarily on eradication of this CSC fraction. However, recent evidence suggests stemness is niche dependent and may represent one of many phenotypic states that can be accessed by many cancer genotypes when presented with specific environmental cues. A better understanding of the relationship of stemness to niche-related phenotypic plasticity could lead to alternative treatment strategies. METHODS:Here we investigate the role of environmental context in the expression of stem-like cell properties through in-silico simulation of ductal carcinoma. We develop a two-dimensional hybrid discrete-continuum cellular automata model to describe the single cell scale dynamics of multi-cellular tissue formation. Through a suite of simulations we investigate interactions between a phenotypically heterogeneous cancer cell population and a dynamic environment. RESULTS:We generate homeostatic ductal structures that consist of a mixture of stem and differentiated cells governed by both intracellular and environmental dynamics. We demonstrate that a wide spectrum of tumor-like histologies can result from these structures by varying microenvironmental parameters. CONCLUSION:Niche driven phenotypic plasticity offers a simple first-principle explanation for the diverse ductal structures observed in histological sections from breast cancer. SIGNIFICANCE:Conventional models of carcinogenesis largely focus on mutational events. We demonstrate that variations in the environmental niche can produce intraductal cancers independent of genetic changes in the resident cells. Therapies targeting the microenvironmental niche, may offer an alternative cancer prevention strategy.},

	abstract = {Detailed modeling and simulation of biochemical systems is complicated by the problem of combinatorial complexity, an explosion in the number of species and reactions due to myriad protein-protein interactions and post-translational modifications. Rule-based modeling overcomes this problem by representing molecules as structured objects and encoding their interactions as pattern-based rules. This greatly simplifies the process of model specification, avoiding the tedious and error prone task of manually enumerating all species and reactions that can potentially exist in a system. From a simulation perspective, rule-based models can be expanded algorithmically into fully-enumerated reaction networks and simulated using a variety of network-based simulation methods, such as ordinary differential equations or Gillespie's algorithm, provided that the network is not exceedingly large. Alternatively, rule-based models can be simulated directly using particle-based kinetic Monte Carlo methods. This "network-free" approach produces exact stochastic trajectories with a computational cost that is independent of network size. However, memory and run time costs increase with the number of particles, limiting the size of system that can be feasibly simulated. Here, we present a hybrid particle/population simulation method that combines the best attributes of both the network-based and network-free approaches. The method takes as input a rule-based model and a user-specified subset of species to treat as population variables rather than as particles. The model is then transformed by a process of "partial network expansion" into a dynamically equivalent form that can be simulated using a population-adapted network-free simulator. The transformation method has been implemented within the open-source rule-based modeling platform BioNetGen, and resulting hybrid models can be simulated using the particle-based simulator NFsim. Performance tests show that significant memory savings can be achieved using the new approach and a monetary cost analysis provides a practical measure of its utility.},

	abstract = {About one person in every two will get cancer during their lives. Surgery and chemotherapy have long been mainstays of cancer treatment. Both, however, have substantial downsides. Surgery may leave behind undetected cancer cells that can grow into new tumours. Furthermore, in response to chemotherapy drugs, some cancer cells may emerge that resist further treatment. There is therefore interest in whether preventive strategies—including lifestyle changes and medications—could reduce the likelihood of confronting a life-threatening cancer. Now, Akhmetzhanov and Hochberg have developed a mathematical model to help compare the effectiveness of preventive strategies and traditional cancer treatments. The model—which assumes that a person can only develop a single cancer from a single region of pre-cancerous cells—suggests that long-term cancer prevention strategies reduce the risk of a life-threatening cancer by more than traditional treatment that begins after a tumour is discovered. The preventive measures may be less effective in some cases compared to traditional treatments if they initially fail to stop a tumour growing, although on average they still work better than treating the cancer after detection. According to Akhmetzhanov and Hochberg's model, surgical removal followed by chemotherapy is less likely to be successful than prevention, and when successful, requires larger impacts on the cancer (and therefore creates more side-effects for the patient) to achieve the same level of control as prevention. The model also suggests that even at very low levels of impact on residual cancer cells, chemotherapies are likely to be counterproductive by boosting the subsequent emergence of treatment-resistant tumours. Akhmetzhanov and Hochberg's model predicts how effective preventive measures need to be in terms of slowing the growth of cancer cells to result in given reductions in the future risk of a life-threatening cancer. Future work should test this model by measuring the effects on tumour growth of prevention and of traditional therapies.},

	abstract = {It is widely assumed in developmental biology and bioengineering that optimal understanding and control of complex living systems follows from models of molecular events. The success of reductionism has overshadowed attempts at top-down models and control policies in biological systems. However, other fields, including physics, engineering and neuroscience, have successfully used the explanations and models at higher levels of organization, including least-action principles in physics and control-theoretic models in computational neuroscience. Exploiting the dynamic regulation of pattern formation in embryogenesis and regeneration requires new approaches to understand how cells cooperate towards large-scale anatomical goal states. Here, we argue that top-down models of pattern homeostasis serve as proof of principle for extending the current paradigm beyond emergence and molecule-level rules. We define top-down control in a biological context, discuss the examples of how cognitive neuroscience and physics exploit these strategies, and illustrate areas in which they may offer significant advantages as complements to the mainstream paradigm. By targeting system controls at multiple levels of organization and demystifying goal-directed (cybernetic) processes, top-down strategies represent a roadmap for using the deep insights of other fields for transformative advances in regenerative medicine and systems bioengineering.},

	abstract = {Colorectal cancer is initiated in colonic crypts. A succession of genetic mutations or epigenetic changes can lead to homeostasis in the crypt being overcome, and subsequent unbounded growth. We consider the dynamics of a single colorectal crypt by using a compartmental approach [Tomlinson IPM, Bodmer WF (1995) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 92:], which accounts for populations of stem cells, differentiated cells, and transit cells. That original model made the simplifying assumptions that each cell population divides synchronously, but we relax these assumptions by adopting an age-structured approach that models asynchronous cell division, and by using a continuum model. We discuss two mechanisms that could regulate the growth of cell numbers and maintain the equilibrium that is normally observed in the crypt. The first will always maintain an equilibrium for all parameter values, whereas the second can allow unbounded proliferation if the net per capita growth rates are large enough. Results show that an increase in cell renewal, which is equivalent to a failure of programmed cell death or of differentiation, can lead to the growth of cancers. The second model can be used to explain the long lag phases in tumor growth, during which new, higher equilibria are reached, before unlimited growth in cell numbers ensues.},

	abstract = {The clinical success of the ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) serves as a model for molecularly targeted therapy of cancer, but at least two critical questions remain. Can imatinib eradicate leukaemic stem cells? What are the dynamics of relapse due to imatinib resistance, which is caused by mutations in the ABL kinase domain? The precise understanding of how imatinib exerts its therapeutic effect in CML and the ability to measure disease burden by quantitative polymerase chain reaction provide an opportunity to develop a mathematical approach. We find that a four-compartment model, based on the known biology of haematopoietic differentiation, can explain the kinetics of the molecular response to imatinib in a 169-patient data set. Successful therapy leads to a biphasic exponential decline of leukaemic cells. The first slope of 0.05 per day represents the turnover rate of differentiated leukaemic cells, while the second slope of 0.008 per day represents the turnover rate of leukaemic progenitors. The model suggests that imatinib is a potent inhibitor of the production of differentiated leukaemic cells, but does not deplete leukaemic stem cells. We calculate the probability of developing imatinib resistance mutations and estimate the time until detection of resistance. Our model provides the first quantitative insights into the in vivo kinetics of a human cancer.},

	abstract = {Thus far, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been disappointing in the inability of investigators to use the results of identified, statistically significant variants in complex diseases to make predictions useful for personalized medicine. Why are significant variables not leading to good prediction of outcomes? We point out that this problem is prevalent in simple as well as complex data, in the sciences as well as the social sciences. We offer a brief explanation and some statistical insights on why higher significance cannot automatically imply stronger predictivity and illustrate through simulations and a real breast cancer example. We also demonstrate that highly predictive variables do not necessarily appear as highly significant, thus evading the researcher using significance-based methods. We point out that what makes variables good for prediction versus significance depends on different properties of the underlying distributions. If prediction is the goal, we must lay aside significance as the only selection standard. We suggest that progress in prediction requires efforts toward a new research agenda of searching for a novel criterion to retrieve highly predictive variables rather than highly significant variables. We offer an alternative approach that was not designed for significance, the partition retention method, which was very effective predicting on a long-studied breast cancer data set, by reducing the classification error rate from 30\% to 8\%.},

	abstract = {A conceptual framework is developed for the quantitative analysis of signal transfer through cellular signal transduction pathways and networks. This approach is referred to as signal transfer analysis and is based on formalisms that were first developed for the analysis of metabolic networks. Signal transduction is quantified as the sensitivity, known as the response coefficient of a target (e.g. an ion channel or transcription factor) to a signal (e.g. a hormone, growth factor or neurotransmitter). This response coefficient is defined in terms of the fractional change in the activated target brought about by a small fractional change in the signal. Quantifying the signal transduction in this way makes it possible to prove that for an idealized signaling cascade without feedback loops, the total response equals the product of all the local response coefficients, one for each level of the cascade. We show under which conditions merely having more levels in a cascade can boost the sensitivity of a target to a signal. If a signal propagates to a target through two different routes, these routes contribute independently to the total response, provided there is no feedback from the target. This independence makes the behavior of signaling cascades different from that of metabolic pathways, where different branches are connected through Kirchhoffs law. The relations between the total response and the local kinetics at each level are given for a number of network structures, such as branched signaling pathways and pathways with feedback. The formalism introduced here may provide a general approach to quantify cellular information transfer.},

In particular, the dynamics of the Erk/Mek system, which has become the canonical example for MAPK signaling systems, have attracted considerable attention. Erk is encoded by two genes, Erk1 and Erk2, that until recently had been considered equivalent as they differ only subtly at the sequence level. However, these proteins exhibit radically different trafficking between cytoplasm and nucleus and this fact may have functional implications. Here we use spatially resolved data on Erk1/2 to develop and analyze spatio-temporal models of these cascades, and we discuss how sensitivity analysis can be used to discriminate between mechanisms. Our models elucidate some of the factors governing the interplay between signaling processes and the Erk1/2 localization in different cellular compartments, including competition between Erk1 and Erk2. Our approach is applicable to a wide range of signaling systems, such as activation cascades, where translocation of molecules occurs. Our study provides a first model of Erk1 and Erk2 activation and their nuclear shuttling dynamics, revealing a role in the regulation of the efficiency of nuclear signaling.},

The Lgr5/R-spondin complex acts by neutralizing Rnf43 and Znrf3, two transmembrane E3 ligases that remove Wnt receptors from the stem cell surface. Rnf43/Znrf3 are themselves encoded by Wnt target genes and constitute a negative Wnt feedback loop.

	abstract = {Despite the presence of mutations in APC or beta-catenin, which are believed to activate the Wnt signalling cascade constitutively, most colorectal cancers show cellular heterogeneity when beta-catenin localization is analysed, indicating a more complex regulation of Wnt signalling. We explored this heterogeneity with a Wnt reporter construct and observed that high Wnt activity functionally designates the colon cancer stem cell (CSC) population. In adenocarcinomas, high activity of the Wnt pathway is observed preferentially in tumour cells located close to stromal myofibroblasts, indicating that Wnt activity and cancer stemness may be regulated by extrinsic cues. In agreement with this notion, myofibroblast-secreted factors, specifically hepatocyte growth factor, activate beta-catenin-dependent transcription and subsequently CSC clonogenicity. More significantly, myofibroblast-secreted factors also restore the CSC phenotype in more differentiated tumour cells both in vitro and in vivo. We therefore propose that stemness of colon cancer cells is in part orchestrated by the microenvironment and is a much more dynamic quality than previously expected that can be defined by high Wnt activity.},

	abstract = {ES cells are defined as self-renewing, pluripotent cell lines derived from early embryos. Cultures of ES cells are also characterized by the expression of certain markers thought to represent the pluripotent state. However, despite the widespread expression of key markers such as Oct4 and the appearance of a characteristic undifferentiated morphology, functional ES cells may represent only a small fraction of the cultures grown under self-renewing conditions. Thus phenotypically "undifferentiated" cells may consist of a heterogeneous population of functionally distinct cell types. Here we use a transgenic allele designed to detect low level transcription in the primitive endoderm lineage as a tool to identify an immediate early endoderm-like ES cell state. This reporter employs a tandem array of internal ribosomal entry sites to drive translation of an enhanced Yellow Fluorescent Protein (Venus) from the transcript that normally encodes for the early endodermal marker Hex. Expression of this Venus transgene reports on single cells with low Hex transcript levels and reveals the existence of distinct populations of Oct4 positive undifferentiated ES cells. One of these cells types, characterized by both the expression of the Venus transgene and the ES cells marker SSEA-1 (V(+)S(+)), appears to represent an early step in primitive endoderm specification. We show that the fraction of cells present within this state is influenced by factors that both promote and suppress primitive endoderm differentiation, but conditions that support ES cell self-renewal prevent their progression into differentiation and support an equilibrium between this state and at least one other that resembles the Nanog positive inner cell mass of the mammalian blastocysts. Interestingly, while these subpopulations are equivalently and clonally interconvertible under self-renewing conditions, when induced to differentiate both in vivo and in vitro they exhibit different behaviours. Most strikingly when introduced back into morulae or blastocysts, the V(+)S(+) population is not effective at contributing to the epiblast and can contribute to the extra-embryonic visceral and parietal endoderm, while the V(-)S(+) population generates high contribution chimeras. Taken together our data support a model in which ES cell culture has trapped a set of interconvertible cell states reminiscent of the early stages in blastocyst differentiation that may exist only transiently in the early embryo.},

We have annotated approximately 617 putative E3s and substrate-recognition subunits of E3 complexes encoded in the human genome. The limited knowledge of the function of members of the large E3 superfamily prompted us to generate genome-wide E3 cDNA and RNAi expression libraries designed for functional screening. An imaging-based screen using these libraries to identify E3s that regulate mitochondrial dynamics uncovered MULAN/FLJ12875, a RING finger protein whose ectopic expression and knockdown both interfered with mitochondrial trafficking and morphology. We found that MULAN is a mitochondrial protein - two transmembrane domains mediate its localization to the organelle's outer membrane. MULAN is oriented such that its E3-active, C-terminal RING finger is exposed to the cytosol, where it has access to other components of the Ub system. Both an intact RING finger and the correct subcellular localization were required for regulation of mitochondrial dynamics, suggesting that MULAN's downstream effectors are proteins that are either integral to, or associated with, mitochondria and that become modified with Ub. Interestingly, MULAN had previously been identified as an activator of NF-kappaB, thus providing a link between mitochondrial dynamics and mitochondria-to-nucleus signaling. These findings suggest the existence of a new, Ub-mediated mechanism responsible for integration of mitochondria into the cellular environment.},

Robustness is often assumed to be an emergent evolved property, but the sloppiness natural to biochemical networks offers an alternative nonadaptive explanation.

In this pathway, Wnt signaling inhibits the degradation of beta-catenin, which can regulate transcription of a number of genes. Some of the genes regulated are those associated with cancer and other diseases (for example, colorectal cancer and melanomas). As a result, components of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway are promising targets in the search for therapeutic agents. Information about Wnt pathways is available both in canonical terms and at the species level.

Recent technological developments in single-cell analysis have enabled high-throughput profiling of gene expression, epigenetic regulation, and spatial relationships amongst cells in complex tissues, but computational approaches that deliver a sensitive and specific joint analysis of these datasets are lacking. We developed LIGER, an algorithm that delineates shared and dataset-specific features of cell identity, allowing flexible modeling of highly heterogeneous single-cell datasets. We demonstrated its broad utility by applying it to four diverse and challenging datasets from human and mouse brain cells. First, we defined both cell-type-specific and sexually dimorphic gene expression in the mouse bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, an anatomically complex brain region that plays important roles in sex-specific behaviors. Second, we analyzed gene expression in the substantia nigra of seven postmortem human subjects, comparing cell states in specific donors, and relating cell types to those in the mouse. Third, we jointly leveraged in situ gene expression and scRNA-seq data to spatially locate fine subtypes of cells present in the mouse frontal cortex. Finally, we integrated mouse cortical scRNA-seq profiles with single-cell DNA methylation signatures, revealing mechanisms of cell-type-specific gene regulation. Integrative analyses using the LIGER algorithm promise to accelerate single-cell investigations of cell-type definition, gene regulation, and disease states.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Our ability to make quantitative measurements in these biochemical circuits has deepened our understanding of what kinds of computations genetic regulatory networks can perform, and with what reliability. These advances have motivated researchers to look for connections between the architecture and function of genetic regulatory networks. Transmitting information between a network's inputs and outputs has been proposed as one such possible measure of function, relevant in certain biological contexts. Here we summarize recent developments in the application of information theory to gene regulatory networks. We first review basic concepts in information theory necessary for understanding recent work. We then discuss the functional complexity of gene regulation, which arises from the molecular nature of the regulatory interactions. We end by reviewing some experiments that support the view that genetic networks responsible for early development of multicellular organisms might be maximizing transmitted 'positional information'.},

	abstract = {Cancer genome sequencing studies indicate that a single breast cancer typically harbours multiple genetically distinct subclones. As carcinogenesis involves a breakdown in the cell-cell cooperation that normally maintains epithelial tissue architecture, individual subclones within a malignant microenvironment are commonly depicted as self-interested competitors. Alternatively, breast cancer subclones might interact cooperatively to gain a selective growth advantage in some cases. Although interclonal cooperation has been shown to drive tumorigenesis in fruitfly models, definitive evidence for functional cooperation between epithelial tumour cell subclones in mammals is lacking. Here we use mouse models of breast cancer to show that interclonal cooperation can be essential for tumour maintenance. Aberrant expression of the secreted signalling molecule Wnt1 generates mixed-lineage mammary tumours composed of basal and luminal tumour cell subtypes, which purportedly derive from a bipotent malignant progenitor cell residing atop a tumour cell hierarchy. Using somatic Hras mutations as clonal markers, we show that some Wnt tumours indeed conform to a hierarchical configuration, but that others unexpectedly harbour genetically distinct basal Hras mutant and luminal Hras wild-type subclones. Both subclones are required for efficient tumour propagation, which strictly depends on luminally produced Wnt1. When biclonal tumours were challenged with Wnt withdrawal to simulate targeted therapy, analysis of tumour regression and relapse revealed that basal subclones recruit heterologous Wnt-producing cells to restore tumour growth. Alternatively, in the absence of a substitute Wnt source, the original subclones often evolve to rescue Wnt pathway activation and drive relapse, either by restoring cooperation or by switching to a defector strategy. Uncovering similar modes of interclonal cooperation in human cancers may inform efforts aimed at eradicating tumour cell communities.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Maintenance of the blood system requires balanced cell fate decisions by hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Because cell fate choices are executed at the individual cell level, new single-cell profiling technologies offer exciting possibilities for mapping the dynamic molecular changes underlying HSPC differentiation. Here, we have used single-cell RNA sequencing to profile more than 1600 single HSPCs, and deep sequencing has enabled detection of an average of 6558 protein-coding genes per cell. Index sorting, in combination with broad sorting gates, allowed us to retrospectively assign cells to 12 commonly sorted HSPC phenotypes while also capturing intermediate cells typically excluded by conventional gating. We further show that independently generated single-cell data sets can be projected onto the single-cell resolution expression map to directly compare data from multiple groups and to build and refine new hypotheses. Reconstruction of differentiation trajectories reveals dynamic expression changes associated with early lymphoid, erythroid, and granulocyte-macrophage differentiation. The latter two trajectories were characterized by common upregulation of cell cycle and oxidative phosphorylation transcriptional programs. By using external spike-in controls, we estimate absolute messenger RNA (mRNA) levels per cell, showing for the first time that despite a general reduction in total mRNA, a subset of genes shows higher expression levels in immature stem cells consistent with active maintenance of the stem-cell state. Finally, we report the development of an intuitive Web interface as a new community resource to permit visualization of gene expression in HSPCs at single-cell resolution for any gene of choice.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This raises the fundamental question of whether HSCs and restricted progenitors reside within distinct, specialized niches or whether they share a common niche. Here we assess the physiological sources of the chemokine CXCL12 for HSC and restricted progenitor maintenance. Cxcl12(DsRed) knock-in mice (DsRed-Express2 recombined into the Cxcl12 locus) showed that Cxcl12 was primarily expressed by perivascular stromal cells and, at lower levels, by endothelial cells, osteoblasts and some haematopoietic cells. Conditional deletion of Cxcl12 from haematopoietic cells or nestin-cre-expressing cells had little or no effect on HSCs or restricted progenitors. Deletion of Cxcl12 from endothelial cells depleted HSCs but not myeloerythroid or lymphoid progenitors. Deletion of Cxcl12 from perivascular stromal cells depleted HSCs and certain restricted progenitors and mobilized these cells into circulation. Deletion of Cxcl12 from osteoblasts depleted certain early lymphoid progenitors but not HSCs or myeloerythroid progenitors, and did not mobilize these cells into circulation. Different stem and progenitor cells thus reside in distinct cellular niches in bone marrow: HSCs occupy a perivascular niche and early lymphoid progenitors occupy an endosteal niche.},

Modern molecular tools have created possibilities for improving and extending the sterile insect technique. As with any new insect control method, questions arise about potential resistance. Genetic RIDL(®)(1) (Release of Insects carrying a Dominant Lethal) technology is a proposed modification of the technique, releasing insects that are homozygous for a repressible dominant lethal genetic construct rather than being sterilized by irradiation. Hypothetical resistance to the lethal mechanism is a potential threat to RIDL strategies' effectiveness. Using population genetic and population dynamic models, we assess the circumstances under which monogenic biochemically based resistance could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of releases for population control. We assume that released insects would be homozygous susceptible to the lethal genetic construct and therefore releases would have a built-in element of resistance dilution. We find that this effect could prevent or limit the spread of resistance to RIDL constructs; the outcomes are subject to competing selective forces deriving from the fitness properties of resistance and the release ratio. Resistance that is spreading and capable of having a significant detrimental impact on population reduction is identifiable, signaling in advance a need for mitigating action.},

The framework has been particularly successful at describing how one should allocate sensory receptors to maximize performance on a given task. Neural networks, in contrast, have made unique contributions to understanding how 'hidden preferences' can emerge as a by-product of sensory design. The two frameworks comprise complementary techniques for understanding the design and the evolution of sensation. This article reviews empirical literature from multiple modalities and levels of sensory processing, considering vision, audition and touch from the viewpoints of sensory ecology and neuroethology. In the process, it presents modifications of extant neural network algorithms that would allow a more effective integration of these diverse approaches. Together, the reviewed literature suggests important advances that can be made by explicitly formulating neural network models in terms of sensory ecology, by incorporating neural costs into models of perceptual evolution and by exploring how such demands interact with historical forces.},

Such models are developed using existing knowledge of the structure and dynamics of the system, experimental observations, and inferences drawn from statistical analysis of empirical data. A key bottleneck in building such models is that some system variables cannot be measured experimentally. These variables are incorporated into the model as numerical \textit{parameters}. Determining values of these parameters that justify existing experiments and provide reliable predictions when model simulations are performed is a key research problem. Domain experts usually estimate the values of these parameters by \textit{fitting} the model to experimental data. Model fitting is usually expressed as an optimization problem that requires minimizing a cost-function which measures some notion of distance between the model and the data. This optimization problem is often solved by combining local and global search methods that tend to perform well for the specific application domain. When some prior information about parameters is available, methods such as Bayesian inference are commonly used for parameter learning. Choosing the appropriate parameter search technique requires detailed domain knowledge and insight into the underlying system. {\textless}h3{\textgreater}Results{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} Using an agent-based model of the dynamics of acute inflammation, we demonstrate a novel parameter estimation algorithm by discovering the amount and schedule of doses of bacterial lipopolysaccharide that guarantee a set of observed clinical outcomes with high probability.

	abstract = {The extensive intratumor heterogeneity revealed by sequencing cancer genomes is an essential determinant of tumor progression, diagnosis, and treatment. What maintains heterogeneity remains an open question because competition within a tumor leads to a strong selection for the fittest subclone. Cancer cells also cooperate by sharing molecules with paracrine effects, such as growth factors, and heterogeneity can be maintained if subclones depend on each other for survival. Without strict interdependence between subclones, however, nonproducer cells can free-ride on the growth factors produced by neighboring producer cells, a collective action problem known in game theory as the "tragedy of the commons," which has been observed in microbial cell populations. Here, we report that similar dynamics occur in cancer cell populations. Neuroendocrine pancreatic cancer (insulinoma) cells that do not produce insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) grow slowly in pure cultures but have a proliferation advantage in mixed cultures, where they can use the IGF-II provided by producer cells. We show that, as predicted by evolutionary game theory, producer cells do not go extinct because IGF-II acts as a nonlinear public good, creating negative frequency-dependent selection that leads to a stable coexistence of the two cell types. Intratumor cell heterogeneity can therefore be maintained even without strict interdependence between cell subclones. Reducing the amount of growth factors available within a tumor may lead to a reduction in growth followed by a new equilibrium, which may explain relapse in therapies that target growth factors.},

	abstract = {The human immune system comprises cells and processes that protect the body against infection and disease. B cells are immune cells that once activated produce antibodies, or proteins that help identify and neutralize infectious microbes and diseased host cells. Antibodies fall into one of ten different classes, and each class has a different, specialized role. Certain antibody classes are responsible for eradicating viruses, while others recruit and help activate additional cells of the immune system. B cells multiply quickly once they are activated. During this proliferation process, dividing B cells can switch from making one class of antibody to another. As such, a single activated B cell can yield a group of related B cells that produce distinct classes of antibodies. Although much has been learned about antibody class switching and its role in generating a diverse set of antibodies, the process of creating different antibody classes in humans remains unknown. Horns, Vollmers et al. now reveal how antibodies of every class are created in living humans. By developing a way to reconstruct the B cell proliferation process and thereby trace the lineage of individual B cells, the occurrence of class switching events could be measured and mapped. This approach revealed that most antibodies are produced via a single dominant pathway that involves first switching through one of two antibody classes. Horns, Vollmers et al. also determined that closely related B cells, which were recently born through division of a common ancestor, often switched to the same class. The shared fate is likely explained by the existence of similar conditions inside each cell, which are inherited during cell division and direct switching toward a particular class. All together, these new findings lay a foundation for developing techniques to direct antibody class switching in ways that support the immune system. Future work will aim to understand the conditions inside a cell that direct switching toward a particular class of antibody.},

The latter two phenomena are also observed in fast growing tumour cells and cell lines. These patterns suggest a fundamental principle of design. In biology such designs can often be understood as the result of the optimization of fitness. Here we show that in basic models of self-replicating systems these patterns are the consequence of maximizing the growth rate. Whereas most models of cellular growth consider a part of physiology, for instance only metabolism, the approach presented here integrates several subsystems to a complete self-replicating system. Such models can yield fundamentally different optimal strategies. In particular, it is shown how the shift in metabolic efficiency originates from a tradeoff between investments in enzyme synthesis and metabolic yields for alternative catabolic pathways. The models elucidate how the optimization of growth by natural selection shapes growth strategies.},

Although these mechanisms have been extensively studied in yeast, little is known about their role in mammalian tissues, despite emerging evidence that stem cell fate is controlled by translational mechanisms3,4. One evolutionarily conserved component of the quality control machinery, Dom34 (in higher eukaryotes known as Pelota (Pelo)), rescues stalled ribosomes 5 . Here we show that Pelo is required for mammalian epidermal homeostasis. Conditional deletion of Pelo in mouse epidermal stem cells that express Lrig1 results in hyperproliferation and abnormal differentiation of these cells. By contrast, deletion of Pelo in Lgr5-expressing stem cells has no effect and deletion in Lgr6-expressing stem cells induces only a mild phenotype. Loss of Pelo results in accumulation of short ribosome footprints and global upregulation of translation, rather than affecting the expression of specific genes. Translational inhibition by rapamycin-mediated downregulation of mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase) rescues the epidermal phenotype. Our study reveals that the ribosome-rescue machinery is important for mammalian tissue homeostasis and that it has specific effects on different stem cell populations.},

To investigate this evolutionary adaptation, we calculated the total number of nucleated marrow cells (NMCs) per cat, observing the distribution of 59Fe to marrow, then multiplied this value (1.9 ± 0.9 × 1010 [mean ± SD]) times the frequency of feline hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) (6 HSCs/107 NMCs) to derive the total number of HSCs per cat (11 400 ± 5400). Surprisingly, when the total number of HSCs per mouse was calculated with a similar experimental and computational approach, the value was equivalent. These data imply that the output of differentiated cells per feline HSC must vastly exceed that of murine HSCs. Furthermore, if the total number of human HSCs were also equivalent to the total number of HSCs in cat and mouse, the frequency of human HSCs would be 0.7 to 1.5 HSCs/108 NMCs, a frequency that is 20-fold less than estimated by the NOD/SCID repopulating assay.},

	abstract = {Epithelial cells undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions have often been shown to behave as cancer stem cells, but the precise molecular connection remains elusive. At the genetic level, stemness is governed by LIN28/let-7 double inhibition switch, whereas EMT/MET is controlled by miR-200/ZEB double inhibition circuit and LIN28 is inhibited by miR-200, coupling the two modules. Here, using a specially devised theoretical framework to investigate the dynamics of the LIN28/let-7 system, we show that it can operate as a three-way switch (between low, high and intermediate LIN28 levels termed the D, U and hybrid D/U states) similar to the three-way operation of the miR-200/ZEB circuit that allows for the existence of a hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) phenotype. We find significant correspondence between the existence of the three states of the two circuits: E–D, M–U and E/M–D/U. Incorporating the activation of OCT4 by LIN28, we find that the hybrid E/M phenotype has high likelihood (when compared with either the E or M states) to gain stemness. Combining the LIN28/let-7 regulation by NF- κ B and c-MYC, we find that NF- κ B, but not c-MYC, elevates the likelihood of E/M phenotype to gain stemness. Our results are consistent with emerging concept that partial EMT can lead to stemness.},

	abstract = {Animals, plants and fungi produce sex cells – known as gametes – when they are preparing to reproduce. These cells are made when cells containing two copies of every gene in the organism divide to produce new cells that each only have one copy of each gene. Therefore, a particular gene copy usually has a 50\% chance of being carried by each gamete. There is a group of genes that selfishly increase their chances of being transmitted to the next generation by destroying the gametes that do not carry them. These “gamete killer” genes can lead to infertility and other health problems. Fission yeast is a fungus that is widely used in research. Previous studies revealed that the yeast are likely to have several gamete killers, but the identities of these genes or how they work were not clear. Nuckolls, Bravo Núñez et al. sought to identify at least one gamete killer gene and understand how it works. The experiments found that a gene called wtf4 acts as a gamete killer in fission yeast. This gene encodes two different proteins, one that acts as a poison and one that acts as an antidote. The antidote remains inside the gametes that contain the wtf4 gene, while the poison is released in the surrounding environment. The poison is capable of killing all of the gametes, but the antidote protects the gametes that contain the wtf4 gene. Further experiments show that wtf4 is just one member of a large family of genes that are also likely to play roles in selectively killing gametes. A separate study by Hu et al. found that two other members of the wtf family also act as gamete killers in fission yeast. Together, these findings expand our understanding of the nature of gamete killers and how they can contribute to infertility. This may guide the search for gamete killers in humans and other organisms. In the future, gamete killers could potentially be used to eradicate populations of pests that damage crops or spread diseases in humans.},

We consider a stochastic dynamical system based on measurable parameters, such as the turnover rate of tumor cells and the rate at which resistant mutants are generated. We find that resistance arises mainly before the start of treatment and, for cancers with high turnover rates, combination therapy is less likely to yield an advantage over single-drug therapy. We apply the mathematical framework to chronic myeloid leukemia. Early-stage chronic myeloid leukemia was the first case to be treated successfully with a targeted drug, imatinib (Novartis, Basel). This drug specifically inhibits the BCR-ABL oncogene, which is required for progression. Although drug resistance prevents successful treatment at later stages of the disease, our calculations suggest that, within the model assumptions, a combination of three targeted drugs with different specificities might overcome the problem of resistance.},

By applying knowledge of the cellular taxonomy of the brain from single-cell RNA sequencing, we evaluated whether the genomic loci implicated in schizophrenia map onto specific brain cell types. We found that the common-variant genomic results consistently mapped to pyramidal cells, medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and certain interneurons, but far less consistently to embryonic, progenitor or glial cells. These enrichments were due to sets of genes that were specifically expressed in each of these cell types. We also found that many of the diverse gene sets previously associated with schizophrenia (genes involved in synaptic function, those encoding mRNAs that interact with FMRP, antipsychotic targets, etc.) generally implicated the same brain cell types. Our results suggest a parsimonious explanation: the common-variant genetic results for schizophrenia point at a limited set of neurons, and the gene sets point to the same cells. The genetic risk associated with MSNs did not overlap with that of glutamatergic pyramidal cells and interneurons, suggesting that different cell types have biologically distinct roles in schizophrenia.},

	abstract = {Lineage specification of hematopoietic stem cells is considered a progressive restriction in lineage potential. This view is consistent with observations that differentiation and lineage specification is preceded by a low-level coexpression of lineage specific, potentially antagonistic genes in early progenitor cells. This coexistence, commonly referred to as priming, disappears in the course of differentiation when certain lineage-restricted genes are upregulated while others are downregulated. Based on this phenomenological description, we propose a quantitative model that describes lineage specification as a competition process between different interacting lineage propensities. The competition is governed by environmental stimuli promoting a drift from a multipotent coexpression to the dominance of one lineage. The assumption of a context-dependent intracellular differentiation control is consistently embedded into our previously proposed model of hematopoietic stem cell organization. The extended model, which comprises self-renewal and lineage specification, is verified using available data on the lineage specification potential of primary hematopoietic stem cells and on the differentiation kinetics of the FDCP-mix cell line. The model provides a number of experimentally testable predictions. From our results, we conclude that lineage specification is best described as a flexible and temporally extended process in which lineage commitment emerges as the result of a sequence of small decision steps. The proposed model provides a novel systems biological view on the functioning of lineage specification in adult tissue stem cells and its connections to the self-renewal properties of these cells. Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest is found at the end of this article.},

	abstract = {The hematopoietic system produces appropriate levels of blood cells over an individual's lifetime through a careful balance of differentiation, proliferation and self-renewal. The acquisition of genetic and epigenetic alterations leads to deregulation of these processes and the development of acute leukemias. A prerequisite to targeted therapies directed against these malignancies is a thorough understanding of the processes that subvert the normal developmental program of the hematopoietic system. This involves identifying the molecular lesions responsible for malignant transformation, their mechanisms of action and the cell type(s) in which they occur. Over the last 3 decades, significant progress has been made through the identification of recurrent genetic alterations and translocations in leukemic blast populations, and their subsequent functional characterization in cell lines and/or mouse models. Recently, primary human hematopoietic cells have emerged as a complementary means to characterize leukemic oncogenes. This approach enables the process of leukemogenesis to be precisely modeled in the appropriate cellular context: from primary human hematopoietic cells to leukemic stem cells capable of initiating disease in vivo. Here we review the model systems used to study leukemogenesis, and focus particularly on recent advances provided by in vitro and in vivo studies with primary human hematopoietic cells.},

The cells can have states with the higher probability ones giving the different cell types. Different cell types correspond to different basins of attractions of the probability landscape. We study how the cells develop from undifferentiated cells to differentiated cells from landscape perspectives. We quantified the Waddington landscape through construction of underlying probability landscape for cell development. We show the developmental process proceeds as moving from undifferentiated to the differentiated basins of attractions. The barrier height of the basins of attractions correlates with the escape time that determines the stability of cell types. We show that the developmental process can be quantitatively described and uncovered by the biological paths on the quantified Waddington landscape from undifferentiated to the differentiated cells. We found the dynamics of the developmental process is controlled by a combination of the gradient and curl force on the landscape. The biological paths often do not follow the steepest descent path on the landscape. The landscape framework also quantifies the possibility of reverse differentiation process such as cell reprogramming from differentiated cells back to the original stem cell. We show that the biological path of reverse differentiation is irreversible and different from the one for differentiation process. We found that the developmental process described by the underlying landscape and the associated biological paths is relatively stable and robust against the influences of environmental perturbations.},

These mechanisms give rise to different mutational processes and their propensity for activation directly affects genomic instability with implications across health and evolution. Here we present a new method to model the activation of at least three alternatives: non-homologous end joining (fast), homologous recombination (slow) and alternative end joining (intermediate) repair. We obtain predictions by employing Bayesian statistics to fit existing biological data to our model and gain insights into the dynamical processes underlying these repair pathways. Our results suggest that data on the repair of breaks using pulse field gel electrophoresis in wild type and mutants confirm at least three disjoint modes of repair. A density weighted integral is proposed as a tool to sum the predicted number of breaks processed by each mechanism from which we quantify the proportions of DSBs repaired by each. Further analysis suggests that the ratio between slow and intermediate repair depends on the presence or absence of DNAPKcs and Ku70. We outline how all these predictions can be directly tested using imaging and sequencing techniques. Most importantly of all, our approach is the first step towards providing a unifying theoretical framework for the dynamics of DNA repair processes.},

Below, we show why this comparison is misleading and provide a detailed discussion of the key critical points in our analysis that have been brought up in Erlich [2017] and in the media.

All mature blood cells are generated from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which are the self-renewing units that sustain lifelong hematopoiesis. HSC behavior, such as self-renewal and quiescence, is regulated by a wide array of factors, including external signaling cues present in the bone marrow. The transforming growth factor-$\beta$ (TGF-$\beta$) family of cytokines constitutes a multifunctional signaling circuitry, which regulates pivotal functions related to cell fate and behavior in virtually all tissues of the body. In the hematopoietic system, TGF-$\beta$ signaling controls a wide spectrum of biological processes, from homeostasis of the immune system to quiescence and self-renewal of HSCs. Here, we review key features and emerging concepts pertaining to TGF-$\beta$ and downstream signaling pathways in normal HSC biology, featuring aspects of aging, hematologic disease, and how this circuitry may be exploited for clinical purposes in the future.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

However, the management of a chronic wound – defined as a barrier defect that has not healed in 3 months – has become a major therapeutic challenge throughout the Western world, and it is a problem that will only escalate with the increasing incidence of conditions that impede wound healing, such as diabetes, obesity and vascular disorders. Despite being clinically and molecularly heterogeneous, all chronic wounds are generally assigned to one of three major clinical categories: leg ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers or pressure ulcers. Although we have gleaned much knowledge about the fundamental cellular and molecular mechanisms that underpin healthy, acute wound healing from various animal models, we have learned much less about chronic wound repair pathology from these models. This might largely be because the animal models being used in this field of research have failed to recapitulate the clinical features of chronic wounds. In this Clinical Puzzle article, we discuss the clinical complexity of chronic wounds and describe the best currently available models for investigating chronic wound pathology. We also assess how such models could be optimised to become more useful tools for uncovering pathological mechanisms and potential therapeutic treatments.},

	abstract = {Heterogeneity between individual cells is a common feature of dynamic cellular processes, including signaling, transcription, and cell fate; yet the overall tissue level physiological phenotype needs to be carefully controlled to avoid fluctuations. Here we show that in the NF-kappaB signaling system, the precise timing of a dual-delayed negative feedback motif [involving stochastic transcription of inhibitor kappaB (IkappaB)-alpha and -epsilon] is optimized to induce heterogeneous timing of NF-kappaB oscillations between individual cells. We suggest that this dual-delayed negative feedback motif enables NF-kappaB signaling to generate robust single cell oscillations by reducing sensitivity to key parameter perturbations. Simultaneously, enhanced cell heterogeneity may represent a mechanism that controls the overall coordination and stability of cell population responses by decreasing temporal fluctuations of paracrine signaling. It has often been thought that dynamic biological systems may have evolved to maximize robustness through cell-to-cell coordination and homogeneity. Our analyses suggest in contrast, that this cellular variation might be advantageous and subject to evolutionary selection. Alternative types of therapy could perhaps be designed to modulate this cellular heterogeneity.},

	abstract = {In multicellular organisms, cells cooperate within a well-defined developmental program. Cancer is a breakdown of such cooperation: cells mutate to phenotypes of uncoordinated proliferation. We study basic principles of the architecture of solid tissues that influence the rate of cancer initiation. In particular, we explore how somatic selection acts to prevent or to promote cancer. Cells with mutations in oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes often have increased proliferation rates. Somatic selection increases their abundance and thus enhances the risk of cancer. Many potentially harmful mutations, however, increase the probability of triggering apoptosis and, hence, initially lead to cells with reduced net proliferation rates. Such cells are eliminated by somatic selection, which therefore also works to reduce the risk of cancer. We show that a tissue organization into small compartments avoids the rapid spread of mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, but promotes genetic instability. In small compartments, genetic instability, which confers a selective disadvantage for the cell, can spread by random drift. If both deleterious and advantageous mutations participate in tumor initiation, then we find an intermediate optimum for the compartment size.},

	abstract = {Advances in single cell genomics provide a way of routinely generating transcriptomics data at the single cell level. A frequent requirement of single cell expression analysis is the identification of novel patterns of heterogeneity across single cells that might explain complex cellular states or tissue composition. To date, classical statistical analysis tools have being routinely applied, but there is considerable scope for the development of novel statistical approaches that are better adapted to the challenges of inferring cellular hierarchies.We have developed a novel agglomerative clustering method that we call pcaReduce to generate a cell state hierarchy where each cluster branch is associated with a principal component of variation that can be used to differentiate two cell states. Using two real single cell datasets, we compared our approach to other commonly used statistical techniques, such as K-means and hierarchical clustering. We found that pcaReduce was able to give more consistent clustering structures when compared to broad and detailed cell type labels.Our novel integration of principal components analysis and hierarchical clustering establishes a connection between the representation of the expression data and the number of cell types that can be discovered. In doing so we found that pcaReduce performs better than either technique in isolation in terms of characterising putative cell states. Our methodology is complimentary to other single cell clustering techniques and adds to a growing palette of single cell bioinformatics tools for profiling heterogeneous cell populations.},

We find that, early in gut development, proliferating progenitors expressing ISC markers are evenly distributed throughout the epithelium, in both the chick and mouse. However, as the villi form, the putative stem cells become restricted to the base of the villi. This shift in the localization is driven by mechanically influenced reciprocal signaling between the epithelium and underlying mesenchyme. Buckling forces physically distort the shape of the morphogenic field, causing local maxima of epithelial signals, in particular Shh, at the tip of each villus. This induces a suite of high-threshold response genes in the underlying mesenchyme to form a signaling center called the "villus cluster." Villus cluster signals, notably Bmp4, feed back on the overlying epithelium to ultimately restrict the stem cells to the base of each villus. VIDEO ABSTRACT.},

In this study, we use gene-targeted knockout mice, adoptive transfer of specific T cell populations, and in vivo Ab treatments to determine the mechanisms by which inflammation is controlled and effector T cell responses are moderated during muscle infection. We report that CD4(+)CD25(-) effector T cells, rather than CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells, suppress inflammation by an IL-10-dependent mechanism that limits IFN-gamma production and local inducible NO synthase induction. Conversely, we show that depletion of regulatory T cells during infection results in exaggerated Th2 responses. Finally, we provide evidence that, in the absence of IL-10, TGF-beta participates in control of local inflammation in infected muscle and promotes parasite survival.},

Mpl also controls circulating TPO concentration via receptor-mediated internalization and degradation. Here, we demonstrate that the megakaryocytosis and increased platelet mass in mice with mutations in the Myb or p300 genes causes reduced circulating TPO concentration and TPO starvation of the stem-cell compartment, which is exacerbated because these cells additionally exhibit impaired responsiveness to TPO. HSCs from Myb(Plt4/Plt4) mice show altered expression of TPO-responsive genes and, like HSCs from Tpo and Mpl mutant mice, exhibit increased cycling and a decline in the number of HSCs with age. These studies suggest that disorders of platelet number can have profound effects on the HSC compartment via effects on the feedback regulation of circulating TPO concentration.},

Given how laborious and lengthy this process can be, the conversion of somatic cells into lineage-specific stem/progenitor cells in one step, without going back to, or through, a pluripotent stage, has opened up tremendous opportunities for regenerative medicine. However, there are a number of obstacles to overcome before these cells can be widely considered for clinical applications.

Cell surface receptors of the SLAM family, including CD150, CD244, and CD48, were differentially expressed among functionally distinct progenitors. HSCs were highly purified as CD150(+)CD244(-)CD48(-) cells while MPPs were CD244(+)CD150(-)CD48(-) and most restricted progenitors were CD48(+)CD244(+)CD150(-). The primitiveness of hematopoietic progenitors could thus be predicted based on the combination of SLAM family members they expressed. This is the first family of receptors whose combinatorial expression precisely distinguishes stem and progenitor cells. The ability to purify HSCs based on a simple combination of SLAM receptors allowed us to identify HSCs in tissue sections. Many HSCs were associated with sinusoidal endothelium in spleen and bone marrow, though some HSCs were associated with endosteum. HSCs thus occupy multiple niches, including sinusoidal endothelium in diverse tissues.},

A biological interface (module) in which cells is linked with ECM (extracellular matrix) by CAMs (cell adhesion molecules) has been proposed as a tool for tracing cancer spatiotemporal dynamics. METHODS:A mathematical model was established to simulate cancer cell migration. Human uterine leiomyoma specimens, in vitro cell migration assay, quantitative real-time PCR, western blotting, dynamic viscosity, and an in vivo C57BL6 mouse model were used to verify the predictive findings of our model. RESULTS:The return to origin probability (RTOP) and its related CAM expression ratio in tumors, so-called "tumor self-seeding", gradually decreased with increased tumor size, and approached the 3D Pólya random walk constant (0.340537) in a periodic structure. The biphasic pattern of cancer cell migration revealed that cancer cells initially grew together and subsequently began spreading. A higher viscosity of fillers applied to the cancer surface was associated with a significantly greater inhibitory effect on cancer migration, in accordance with the Stokes-Einstein equation. CONCLUSION:The positional probability and cell-CAM-ECM interface (module) in the fractal framework helped us decipher cancer spatiotemporal dynamics; in addition we modeled the methods of cancer control by manipulating the microenvironment plasticity or inhibiting the CAM expression to the Pólya random walk, Pólya constant.},

We model the interaction between naive T cells, effector T cells, and CML cancer cells in the body, using a system of ordinary differential equations which gives rates of change of the three cell populations. One of the difficulties in modeling CML is the scarcity of experimental data which can be used to estimate parameters values. To compensate for the resulting uncertainties, we use Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) on large ranges of possible parameter values in our analysis. A major goal of this work is the determination of parameters which play a critical role in remission or clearance of the cancer in the model. Our analysis examines 12 parameters, and identifies two of these, the growth and death rates of CML, as critical to the outcome of the system. Our results indicate that the most promising research avenues for treatments of CML should be those that affect these two significant parameters (CML growth and death rates), while altering the other parameters should have little effect on the outcome.},

Here, we introduce Cicero, an algorithm that identifies co-accessible pairs of DNA elements using single-cell chromatin accessibility data and so connects regulatory elements to their putative target genes. We apply Cicero to investigate how dynamically accessible elements orchestrate gene regulation in differentiating myoblasts. Groups of Cicero-linked regulatory elements meet criteria of "chromatin hubs"—they are enriched for physical proximity, interact with a common set of transcription factors, and undergo coordinated changes in histone marks that are predictive of changes in gene expression. Pseudotemporal analysis revealed that most DNA elements remain in chromatin hubs throughout differentiation. A subset of elements bound by MYOD1 in myoblasts exhibit early opening in a PBX1- and MEIS1-dependent manner. Our strategy can be applied to dissect the architecture, sequence determinants, and mechanisms of \textit{cis}-regulation on a genome-wide scale.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Differentiation of uncommitted T cells into Th1 and Th2 subpopulations depends on both intracellular events controlling expression of transcription factors T-bet and GATA-3 and interactions between cells mediated by cytokines, particularly IL4 and IFNgamma. A great deal is known about the intracellular and extracellular events involved in Th1 and Th2 (Th) differentiation, but how these are integrated in T-cell populations or indeed why extracellular cytokine control is required after a decision has been made at a transcriptional level is not at all understood. We present a mathematical model of CD4+ T-cell differentiation that describes both intracellular and extracellular processes and the interactions between them. It shows how antigen stimulation in conjunction with cytokines and other extracellular signals gives rise to rapid, reversible and mutually exclusive expression of T-bet or GATA-3 due to feedback between the transcription factors and their signalling pathways. After transient signalling by APC, continued Th1 and Th2 differentiation is shown to require cytokine production by the proliferating T cells. Moreover, intercellular communication by T-cell-derived cytokines lowers the threshold of APC signals required for Th differentiation. This provides an explanation for enhanced Th differentiation by pre-existing memory T cells. The model also predicts that Th differentiation can be reversed at the single cell level before commitment by manipulating the cytokine environment. It suggests a mechanism for switching between Th1 and Th2 in the so-called irreversible state that may be developed as a novel therapeutic means of manipulating Th1 and Th2 responses.},

Here, we present a systematic time-lapse analysis of UB branching morphogenesis during the early development of the mouse kidney in organ culture. Metanephric primordia from Hoxb7/GFP transgenic embryos were cultured for 3-4 days, and GFP images of the UB taken every 30 min were assembled into movies. Analysis of these movies (available as )revealed that the UB is a highly plastic structure, which can branch in a variety of complex patterns, including terminal bifid, terminal trifid, and lateral branching. To examine kinetic parameters of branching and elongation, skeletal representations of the UB were used to measure the number of segments and branch points and the length of each segment as a function of time and of branch generation. These measurements provide a baseline for future studies on mutant kidneys with defects in renal development. To illustrate how these quantitative methods can be applied to the analysis of abnormal kidney development, we examined the effects of the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 on renal organ cultures and confirmed a previous report that the drug has a specific inhibitory effect on UB branching as opposed to elongation.},

	abstract = {Recent ChIP experiments of human and mouse embryonic stem cells have elucidated the architecture of the transcriptional regulatory circuitry responsible for cell determination, which involves the transcription factors OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG. In addition to regulating each other through feedback loops, these genes also regulate downstream target genes involved in the maintenance and differentiation of embryonic stem cells. A search for the OCT4-SOX2-NANOG network motif in other species reveals that it is unique to mammals. With a kinetic modeling approach, we ascribe function to the observed OCT4-SOX2-NANOG network by making plausible assumptions about the interactions between the transcription factors at the gene promoter binding sites and RNA polymerase (RNAP), at each of the three genes as well as at the target genes. We identify a bistable switch in the network, which arises due to several positive feedback loops, and is switched on/off by input environmental signals. The switch stabilizes the expression levels of the three genes, and through their regulatory roles on the downstream target genes, leads to a binary decision: when OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG are expressed and the switch is on, the self-renewal genes are on and the differentiation genes are off. The opposite holds when the switch is off. The model is extremely robust to parameter changes. In addition to providing a self-consistent picture of the transcriptional circuit, the model generates several predictions. Increasing the binding strength of NANOG to OCT4 and SOX2, or increasing its basal transcriptional rate, leads to an irreversible bistable switch: the switch remains on even when the activating signal is removed. Hence, the stem cell can be manipulated to be self-renewing without the requirement of input signals. We also suggest tests that could discriminate between a variety of feedforward regulation architectures of the target genes by OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG.},

	abstract = {The availability of several methods to unambiguously mark individual cells has strongly fostered the understanding of clonal developments in hematopoiesis and other stem cell driven regenerative tissues. While cellular barcoding is the method of choice for experimental studies, patients that underwent gene therapy carry a unique insertional mark within the transplanted cells originating from the integration of the retroviral vector. Close monitoring of such patients allows accessing their clonal dynamics, however, the early detection of events that predict monoclonal conversion and potentially the onset of leukemia are beneficial for treatment. We developed a simple mathematical model of a self-stabilizing hematopoietic stem cell population to generate a wide range of possible clonal developments, reproducing typical, experimentally and clinically observed scenarios. We use the resulting model scenarios to suggest and test a set of statistical measures that should allow for an interpretation and classification of relevant clonal dynamics. Apart from the assessment of several established diversity indices we suggest a measure that quantifies the extension to which the increase in the size of one clone is attributed to the total loss in the size of all other clones. By evaluating the change in relative clone sizes between consecutive measurements, the suggested measure, referred to as maximum relative clonal expansion ( mRCE ), proves to be highly sensitive in the detection of rapidly expanding cell clones prior to their dominant manifestation. This predictive potential places the mRCE as a suitable means for the early recognition of leukemogenesis especially in gene therapy patients that are closely monitored. Our model based approach illustrates how simulation studies can actively support the design and evaluation of preclinical strategies for the analysis and risk evaluation of clonal developments.},

Autophagy is regulated by cell signalling such as the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway. However, the significance of autophagy in modulation of signal transduction is unclear. Here we show that autophagy negatively regulates Wnt signalling by promoting Dishevelled (Dvl) degradation. Von Hippel-Lindau protein-mediated ubiquitylation is critical for the binding of Dvl2 to p62, which in turn facilitates the aggregation and the LC3-mediated autophagosome recruitment of Dvl2 under starvation; the ubiquitylated Dvl2 aggregates are ultimately degraded through the autophagy-lysosome pathway. Moreover, a reverse correlation between Dvl expression and autophagy is observed in late stages of colon cancer development, indicating that autophagy may contribute to the aberrant activation of Wnt signalling in tumour formation.},

In conservation, SARs have been used to predict the number of extinctions when the area of habitat is reduced. Such predictions are most needed for landscapes rather than for individual habitat fragments, but SAR-based predictions of extinctions for landscapes with highly fragmented habitat are likely to be biased because SAR assumes contiguous habitat. In reality, habitat loss is typically accompanied by habitat fragmentation. To quantify the effect of fragmentation in addition to the effect of habitat loss on the number of species, we extend the power-law SAR to the species-fragmented area relationship. This model unites the single-species metapopulation theory with the multispecies SAR for communities. We demonstrate with a realistic simulation model and with empirical data for forest-inhabiting subtropical birds that the species-fragmented area relationship gives a far superior prediction than SAR of the number of species in fragmented landscapes. The results demonstrate that for communities of species that are not well adapted to live in fragmented landscapes, the conventional SAR underestimates the number of extinctions for landscapes in which little habitat remains and it is highly fragmented.},

Wnt signaling and cadherin-mediated adhesion have been implicated in both processes; clarifying their role will depend on linking them to rearrangements of cellular structure and behavior. beta-Catenin is an essential molecule both in cadherin-mediated cell adhesion and in canonical Wnt signaling. Numerous experiments have shown that the loss of cadherin-mediated cell adhesion can promote beta-catenin release and signaling; this is accomplished by proteases, protein kinases and other molecules. Cadherin loss can also signal to several other regulatory pathways. Additionally, many target genes of Wnt signaling influence cadherin adhesion. The most conspicuous of these Wnt target genes encode the transcription factors Twist and Slug, which directly inhibit the E-cadherin gene promoter. Other Wnt/beta-catenin target genes encode metalloproteases or the cell adhesion molecule L1, which favor the degradation of E-cadherin. These factors provide a mechanism whereby cadherin loss and increased Wnt signaling induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition in both carcinomas and development.},

To infer transcription kinetics for a gene-of-interest, researchers commonly compare the distribution of mRNA copy-number to the prediction of a theoretical model. However, the reliability of this procedure is limited because the measured mRNA numbers represent integration over the mRNA lifetime, contribution from multiple gene copies, and mixing of cells from different cell-cycle phases. We address these limitations by simultaneously quantifying nascent and mature mRNA in individual cells, and incorporating cell-cycle effects in the analysis of mRNA statistics. We demonstrate our approach on Oct4 and Nanog in mouse embryonic stem cells. Both genes follow similar two-state kinetics. However, Nanog exhibits slower ON/OFF switching, resulting in increased cell-to-cell variability in mRNA levels. Early in the cell cycle, the two copies of each gene exhibit independent activity. After gene replication, the probability of each gene copy to be active diminishes, resulting in dosage compensation.},

Many niches and their intercellular signaling pathways are known, but for the most part, the key downstream targets of niche signaling remain elusive. Here, we report the discovery of two GLP-1/Notch target genes, lst-1 (lateral signaling target) and sygl-1 (synthetic Glp), that function redundantly to maintain germ-line stem cells (GSCs) in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Whereas lst-1 and sygl-1 single mutants appear normal, lst-1 sygl-1 double mutants are phenotypically indistinguishable from glp-1/Notch mutants. Multiple lines of evidence demonstrate that GLP-1/Notch signaling activates lst-1 and sygl-1 expression in GSCs within the niche. Therefore, these two genes fully account for the role of GLP-1/Notch signaling in GSC maintenance. Importantly, lst-1 and sygl-1 are not required for GLP-1/Notch signaling per se. We conclude that lst-1 and sygl-1 forge a critical link between Notch signaling and GSC maintenance.},

	abstract = {Embryonic kidney development begins with the outgrowth of the ureteric bud (UB) from the Wolffian duct (WD) into the adjacent metanephric mesenchyme (MM). Both a GDNF-dependent and GDNF-independent (Maeshima et al., 2007) pathway have been identified. In vivo and in vitro, the GDNF-dependent pathway is inhibited by BMPs, one of the factors invoked to explain the limitation of UB formation in the unbudded regions of the WD surrounding the UB. However, the exact mechanism remains unknown. Here a previously described in vitro system that models UB budding from the WD was utilized to study this process. Because Protein kinase A (PKA) activation has been shown to prevent migration, morphogenesis and tubulogenesis of epithelial cells (Santos et al., 1993), its activity in budded and non-budded portions of the GDNF-induced WD was analyzed. The level of PKA activity was 15-fold higher in the unbudded portions of the WD compared to budded portions, suggesting that PKA activity plays a key role in controlling the site of UB emergence. Using well-characterized PKA agonists and antagonists, we demonstrated that at various levels of the PKA-signaling hierarchy, PKA regulates UB outgrowth from the WD by suppressing budding events. This process appeared to be PKA-2 isoform specific, and mediated by changes in the duct rather than the surrounding mesenchyme. In addition, it was not due to changes in either the sorting of junctional proteins, cell death, or cell proliferation. Furthermore, the suppressive effect of cAMP on budding did not appear to be mediated by spread to adjacent cells via gap junctions. Conversely, antagonism of PKA activity stimulated UB outgrowth from the WD and resulted in both an increase in the number of buds per unit length of WD as well as a larger surface area per bud. Using microarrays, analysis of gene expression in GDNF-treated WDs in which the PKA pathway had been activated revealed a nearly 14-fold decrease in Ret, a receptor for GDNF. A smaller decrease in GFRα1. a co-receptor for GDNF, was also observed. Using Ret-null WDs, we were able to demonstrate that PKA regulated GDNF-dependent budding but not GDNF-independent pathway for WD budding. We also found that BMP2 was higher in unbudded regions of the GDNF-stimulated WD. Treatment of isolated WDs with BMP2 suppressed budding and resulted in a 3-fold increase in PKA activity. The data suggests that the suppression of budding by BMPs and possibly other factors in non-budded zones of the WD may be regulated in part by increased PKA activity, probably partially through downregulation of Ret/GFRα1 coreceptor expression.},

The argument is that because the interaction between the spins dissolved in the matrix oscillates in sign according to distance, there will be no mean ferro- or antiferromagnetism, but there will be a ground state with the spins aligned in definite directions, even if these directions appear to be at random. At the critical temperature the existence of these preferred directions affects the orientation of the spins, leading to a cusp in the susceptibility. This cusp is smoothed by an external field. Although the behaviour at low t needs a quantum mechanical treatment, it is interesting to complete the classical calculations down to t=0. Classically the susceptibility tends to a constant value at t=0, and the specific heat to a constant value.},

	abstract = {Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) methods perform inference on model-specific parameters of mechanistically motivated parametric models when evaluating likelihoods is difficult. Central to the success of ABC methods, which have been used frequently in biology, is computationally inexpensive simulation of data sets from the parametric model of interest. However, when simulating data sets from a model is so computationally expensive that the posterior distribution of parameters cannot be adequately sampled by ABC, inference is not straightforward. We present "approximate approximate Bayesian computation" (AABC), a class of computationally fast inference methods that extends ABC to models in which simulating data is expensive. In AABC, we first simulate a number of data sets small enough to be computationally feasible to simulate from the parametric model. Conditional on these data sets, we use a statistical model that approximates the correct parametric model and enables efficient simulation of a large number of data sets. We show that under mild assumptions, the posterior distribution obtained by AABC converges to the posterior distribution obtained by ABC, as the number of data sets simulated from the parametric model and the sample size of the observed data set increase. We demonstrate the performance of AABC on a population-genetic model of natural selection, as well as on a model of the admixture history of hybrid populations. This latter example illustrates how, in population genetics, AABC is of particular utility in scenarios that rely on conceptually straightforward but potentially slow forward-in-time simulations.},

Inherent to this knowledge is also the desire to optimally engineer stem cells to interact with their target niche (such as after transplantation), or to lure malignant stem cells out of their protective niches (in order to kill them), and in general to decipher the niche's structural components and its organization. Whereas, with the exception of the recent addition of CXCR4 antagonists to the armamentarium for mobilization of patients refractory to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor alone, clinical stem cell mobilization has not changed significantly over the last decade or so, much effort has been made trying to explain the complex mechanism(s) by which hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells leave the marrow. This brief review will report some of the more recent advances about mobilization, with an attempt to reconcile some of the seemingly inconsistent data in mobilization and to interject some commonalities among different mobilization regimes.Leukemia advance online publication, 5 October 2012; doi:10.1038/leu.2012.254.},

Over the past decade, there has been significant progress in our understanding of renal branching morphogenesis and its regulation, and this review focuses on several areas in which there have been recent advances. The first section deals with the normal process of UB branching morphogenesis, and methods that have been developed to better observe and describe it. The next section discusses a number of experimental methodologies, both established and novel, that make kidney development in the mouse a powerful and attractive experimental system. The third section discusses some of the cellular processes that are likely to underlie UB branching morphogenesis, as well as recent data on cell lineages within the growing UB. The fourth section summarizes our understanding of the roles of two groups of growth factors that appear to be particularly important for the regulation of UB outgrowth and branching: GDNF and FGFs, which stimulate this process via tyrosine kinase receptors, and members of the TGFbeta family, including BMP4 and Activin A, which generally inhibit UB formation and branching.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION:Computer simulations have become an important tool across the biomedical sciences and beyond. For many important problems several different models or hypotheses exist and choosing which one best describes reality or observed data is not straightforward. We therefore require suitable statistical tools that allow us to choose rationally between different mechanistic models of, e.g. signal transduction or gene regulation networks. This is particularly challenging in systems biology where only a small number of molecular species can be assayed at any given time and all measurements are subject to measurement uncertainty. RESULTS:Here, we develop such a model selection framework based on approximate Bayesian computation and employing sequential Monte Carlo sampling. We show that our approach can be applied across a wide range of biological scenarios, and we illustrate its use on real data describing influenza dynamics and the JAK-STAT signalling pathway. Bayesian model selection strikes a balance between the complexity of the simulation models and their ability to describe observed data. The present approach enables us to employ the whole formal apparatus to any system that can be (efficiently) simulated, even when exact likelihoods are computationally intractable.},

A critical mediator of key cell-cell signaling events during embryogenesis is the highly conserved Wnt family of secreted proteins. Recent biochemical and genetic analyses have greatly enriched our understanding of how Wnts signal, and the list of canonical Wnt signaling components has exploded. The data reveal that multiple extracellular, cytoplasmic, and nuclear regulators intricately modulate Wnt signaling levels. In addition, receptor-ligand specificity and feedback loops help to determine Wnt signaling outputs. Wnts are required for adult tissue maintenance, and perturbations in Wnt signaling promote both human degenerative diseases and cancer.

An inherent problem with this approach is that the presence of specific cell surface markers does not directly reflect the transcriptional state of a cell. Here, we used a marker-free approach to computationally reconstruct the blood lineage tree in zebrafish and order cells along their differentiation trajectory, based on their global transcriptional differences. Within the population of transcriptionally similar stem and progenitor cells, our analysis reveals considerable cell-to-cell differences in their probability to transition to another committed state. Once fate decision is executed, the suppression of transcription of ribosomal genes and upregulation of lineage-specific factors coordinately controls lineage differentiation. Evolutionary analysis further demonstrates that this haematopoietic programme is highly conserved between zebrafish and higher vertebrates.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Extracting relevant biological information from large data sets is a major challenge in functional genomics research. Different aspects of the data hamper their biological interpretation. For instance, 5000-fold differences in concentration for different metabolites are present in a metabolomics data set, while these differences are not proportional to the biological relevance of these metabolites. However, data analysis methods are not able to make this distinction. Data pretreatment methods can correct for aspects that hinder the biological interpretation of metabolomics data sets by emphasizing the biological information in the data set and thus improving their biological interpretability. RESULTS:Different data pretreatment methods, i.e. centering, autoscaling, pareto scaling, range scaling, vast scaling, log transformation, and power transformation, were tested on a real-life metabolomics data set. They were found to greatly affect the outcome of the data analysis and thus the rank of the, from a biological point of view, most important metabolites. Furthermore, the stability of the rank, the influence of technical errors on data analysis, and the preference of data analysis methods for selecting highly abundant metabolites were affected by the data pretreatment method used prior to data analysis. CONCLUSION:Different pretreatment methods emphasize different aspects of the data and each pretreatment method has its own merits and drawbacks. The choice for a pretreatment method depends on the biological question to be answered, the properties of the data set and the data analysis method selected. For the explorative analysis of the validation data set used in this study, autoscaling and range scaling performed better than the other pretreatment methods. That is, range scaling and autoscaling were able to remove the dependence of the rank of the metabolites on the average concentration and the magnitude of the fold changes and showed biologically sensible results after PCA (principal component analysis).In conclusion, selecting a proper data pretreatment method is an essential step in the analysis of metabolomics data and greatly affects the metabolites that are identified to be the most important.},

One approach to resolving this question is to determine the lineage potentials of the earliest thymic progenitors (ETPs). Previous work has shown that ETPs possess T and natural killer lymphoid potentials, and rare subsets of ETPs also possess B lymphoid potential, suggesting an origin from lymphoid-restricted progenitor cells. However, whether ETPs also possess myeloid potential is unknown. Here we show that nearly all ETPs in adult mice possess both T and myeloid potential in clonal assays. The existence of progenitors possessing T and myeloid potential within the thymus is incompatible with the current dominant model of haematopoiesis, in which T cells are proposed to arise from lymphoid-.

For example, cell migration studies have investigated the heterogeneity of invasiveness and taxis in development, wound healing, and cancer. However, relatively little effort has been devoted to explore when heterogeneity is mechanistically relevant and how to reliably measure it. Statistical methods from the animal movement literature offer the potential to analyse heterogeneity in collections of cell tracking data. A popular measure of heterogeneity, which we use here as an example, is the distribution of delays in directional cross-correlation. Employing a suitably generic, yet minimal, model of collective cell movement in three dimensions, we show how using such measures to quantify heterogeneity in tracking data can result in the inference of heterogeneity where there is none. Our study highlights a potential pitfall in the statistical analysis of cell population heterogeneity, and we argue this can be mitigated by the appropriate choice of null models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Efforts such as The Cancer Genome Atlas are systematically characterizing the structural basis of cancer, by identifying the genomic mutations associated with each cancer type. A powerful complementary approach is to systematically characterize the functional basis of cancer, by identifying the genes essential for growth and related phenotypes in different cancer cells. Such information would be particularly valuable for identifying potential drug targets. Here, we report the development of an efficient, robust approach to perform genome-scale pooled shRNA screens for both positive and negative selection and its application to systematically identify cell essential genes in 12 cancer cell lines. By integrating these functional data with comprehensive genetic analyses of primary human tumors, we identified known and putative oncogenes such as EGFR, KRAS, MYC, BCR-ABL, MYB, CRKL, and CDK4 that are essential for cancer cell proliferation and also altered in human cancers. We further used this approach to identify genes involved in the response of cancer cells to tumoricidal agents and found 4 genes required for the response of CML cells to imatinib treatment: PTPN1, NF1, SMARCB1, and SMARCE1, and 5 regulators of the response to FAS activation, FAS, FADD, CASP8, ARID1A and CBX1. Broad application of this highly parallel genetic screening strategy will not only facilitate the rapid identification of genes that drive the malignant state and its response to therapeutics but will also enable the discovery of genes that participate in any biological process.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Waddington9s epigenetic landscape is a classic metaphor for describing the cellular dynamics during the development modulated by gene regulation. Quantifying Waddington9s epigenetic landscape by mathematical modeling would be useful for understanding the mechanisms of cell fate determination. A few computational methods have been proposed for quantitative modeling of landscape; however, to model and visualize the landscape of a high dimensional gene regulatory system with realistic details is still challenging. Here, we propose a Monte Carlo method for modeling the Waddington9s epigenetic landscape of a gene regulatory network (GRN). The method estimates the probability distribution of cellular states by collecting a large number of time-course simulations with random initial conditions. By projecting all the trajectories into a 2-dimensional plane of dimension i and j, we can approximately calculate the quasi-potential U(x{\textasciicircum}i, x{\textasciicircum}j) = {\textbackslash}textminusln P(x{\textasciicircum}i, x{\textasciicircum}j), where P(x{\textasciicircum}i, x{\textasciicircum}j ) is the estimated probability of an equilibrium steady state or a non-equilibrium state. A state with locally maximal probability corresponds to a locally minimal potential and such a state is called an attractor. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our Monte Carlo method can quantify the global potential landscape of GRN for a high dimensional system. The same topography of landscape can be produced from deterministic or stochastic time-course simulations. The potential landscapes show that not only attractors represent stability, but the paths between attractors are also part of the stability or robustness of biological systems. We demonstrate the novelty and reliability of our method by plotting the potential landscapes of a few published models of GRN. Besides GRN-driven landscapes of cellular dynamics, the algorithm proposed can also be applied to studies of global dynamics of other dynamical systems.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

To test this we performed in vivo live imaging of dermal fibroblasts, which revealed that homeostatic tissue architecture is achieved without active cell migration.

	abstract = {To systematically understand the interactions between numerous biological components, a variety of biological networks on different levels and scales have been constructed and made available in public databases or knowledge repositories. Graphical models such as structural equation models have long been used to describe biological networks for various quantitative analysis tasks, especially key biological parameter estimation. However, limited by resources or technical capacities, partial observation is a common problem in experimental observations of biological networks, and it thus becomes an important problem how to select unobserved nodes for additional measurements such that all unknown model parameters become identifiable. To the best knowledge of our authors, a solution to this problem does not exist until this study. The identifiability-based observation problem for biological networks is mathematically formulated for the first time based on linear recursive structural equation models, and then a dynamic programming strategy is developed to obtain the optimal observation strategies. The efficiency of the dynamic programming algorithm is achieved by avoiding both symbolic computation and matrix operations as used in other studies. We also provided necessary theoretical justifications to the proposed method. Finally, we verified the algorithm using synthetic network structures and illustrated the application of the proposed method in practice using a real biological network related to influenza A virus infection. The proposed approach is the first solution to the structural identifiability-based optimal observation remedy problem. It is applicable to an arbitrary directed acyclic biological network (recursive SEMs) without bidirectional edges, and it is a computerizable method. Observation remedy is an important issue in experiment design for biological networks, and we believe that this study provides a solid basis for dealing with more challenging design issues (e.g., feedback loops, dynamic or nonlinear networks) in the future.

These decisions can be directly linked to survival, as the sporulation/competence choice in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, or be involved in the establishment of developmental programs from pluripotent stem cells. How are these decisions controlled at the molecular level? Recent studies have identified the presence of a few master regulator genes whose activity is crucial to drive cells to a particular fate. These genes usually exhibit autoregulation and appear in combination with a second molecular partner constituting a minimal regulatory circuit. Here, we investigate how such two-component architectures endow cells with more than two epigenetic states. This ability not only enhances the number of potential developmental outcomes, in a given context, but also drastically increases cell signal processing. We show how these control modules can implement a number of complex computational tasks such as discrimination of stimulus amplitude, duration, or relative timing. Similar aspects have been discussed in relation to neural dynamics in cortical circuits, which suggests the use of equivalent computational strategies and circuit design in the control of biological decision-making.},

We show that genetic hierarchies of somatic and gametic parasitism following fusion can be replicated by transplanting cells between colonies. We prospectively isolate a population of multipotent, self-renewing stem cells that retain their competitive phenotype upon transplantation. Their single-cell contribution to either somatic or germline fates, but not to both, is consistent with separate lineages of somatic and germline stem cells or pluripotent stem cells that differentiate according to the niche in which they land. Since fusion is restricted to individuals that share a fusion/histocompatibility allele, these data suggest that histocompatibility genes in Botryllus evolved to protect the body from parasitic stem cells usurping asexual or sexual inheritance.},

	abstract = {Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired clonal blood disorder characterized by hemolysis and a high risk of thrombosis, that is due to a deficiency in several cell surface proteins that prevent complement activation. Its origin has been traced to a somatic mutation in the PIG-A gene within hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). However, to date the question of how this mutant clone expands in size to contribute significantly to hematopoiesis remains under debate. One hypothesis posits the existence of a selective advantage of PIG-A mutated cells due to an immune mediated attack on normal HSC, but the evidence supporting this hypothesis is inconclusive. An alternative (and simpler) explanation attributes clonal expansion to neutral drift, in which case selection neither favours nor inhibits expansion of PIG-A mutated HSC. Here we examine the implications of the neutral drift model by numerically evolving a Markov chain for the probabilities of all possible outcomes, and investigate the possible occurrence and evolution, within this framework, of multiple independently arising clones within the HSC pool. Predictions of the model agree well with the known incidence of the disease and average age at diagnosis. Notwithstanding the slight difference in clonal expansion rates between our results and those reported in the literature, our model results lead to a relative stability of clone size when averaging multiple cases, in accord with what has been observed in human trials. The probability of a patient harbouring a second clone in the HSC pool was found to be extremely low ({\textbackslash}textasciitilde10-8). Thus our results suggest that in clinical cases of PNH where two independent clones of mutant cells are observed, only one of those is likely to have originated in the HSC pool.},

Using simulations to calculate statistics or to explore parameter space is a common means for analysing these models and can be computationally intensive. However, in many cases, the simulations are easily parallelizable. Graphics processing units (GPUs) are capable of efficiently running highly parallel programs and outperform CPUs in terms of raw computing power. Despite their computational advantages, their adoption by the systems biology community is relatively slow, since differences in hardware architecture between GPUs and CPUs complicate the porting of existing code. RESULTS:We present a Python package, cuda-sim, that provides highly parallelized algorithms for the repeated simulation of biochemical network models on NVIDIA CUDA GPUs. Algorithms are implemented for the three popular types of model formalisms: the LSODA algorithm for ODE integration, the Euler-Maruyama algorithm for SDE simulation and the Gillespie algorithm for MJP simulation. No knowledge of GPU computing is required from the user. Models can be specified in SBML format or provided as CUDA code. For running a large number of simulations in parallel, up to 360-fold decrease in simulation runtime is attained when compared to single CPU implementations.

	abstract = {Cell differentiation is typically directed by external signals that drive opposing regulatory pathways. Studying differentiation under polarizing conditions, with only one input signal provided, is limited in its ability to resolve the logic of interactions between opposing pathways. Dissection of this logic can be facilitated by mapping the system's response to mixtures of input signals, which are expected to occur in vivo, where cells are simultaneously exposed to various signals with potentially opposing effects. Here, we systematically map the response of naïve T cells to mixtures of signals driving differentiation into the Th1 and Th2 lineages. We characterize cell state at the single cell level by measuring levels of the two lineage-specific transcription factors (T-bet and GATA3) and two lineage characteristic cytokines (IFN-γ and IL-4) that are driven by these transcription regulators. We find a continuum of mixed phenotypes in which individual cells co-express the two lineage-specific master regulators at levels that gradually depend on levels of the two input signals. Using mathematical modeling we show that such tunable mixed phenotype arises if autoregulatory positive feedback loops in the gene network regulating this process are gradual and dominant over cross-pathway inhibition. We also find that expression of the lineage-specific cytokines follows two independent stochastic processes that are biased by expression levels of the master regulators. Thus, cytokine expression is highly heterogeneous under mixed conditions, with subpopulations of cells expressing only IFN-γ, only IL-4, both cytokines, or neither. The fraction of cells in each of these subpopulations changes gradually with input conditions, reproducing the continuous internal state at the cell population level. These results suggest a differentiation scheme in which cells reflect uncertainty through a continuously tuneable mixed phenotype combined with a biased stochastic decision rather than a binary phenotype with a deterministic decision.},

Aberrant secretion by cancer cells can modulate this intercellular communication, in particular in highly organised tissues such as the liver. Hepatocytes, the major cell type of the liver, secrete Dickkopf (Dkk), which inhibits Wnt/ \textit{$\beta$}-catenin signalling in an autocrine and paracrine manner. Consequently, Dkk modulates the expression of Wnt/ \textit{$\beta$}-catenin target genes. We present a mathematical model that describes the autocrine and paracrine regulation of hepatic gene expression by Dkk under wild-type conditions as well as in the presence of mutant cells. {\textless}h3{\textgreater}Results{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} Our spatial model describes the competition of Dkk and Wnt at receptor level, intra-cellular Wnt/ \textit{$\beta$}-catenin signalling, and the regulation of target gene expression for 21 individual hepatocytes. Autocrine and paracrine regulation is mediated through a feedback mechanism via Dkk and Dkk diffusion along the porto-central axis. Along this axis an APC concentration gradient is modelled as experimentally detected in liver. Simulations of mutant cells demonstrate that already a single mutant cell increases overall Dkk concentration. The influence of the mutant cell on gene expression of surrounding wild-type hepatocytes is limited in magnitude and restricted to hepatocytes in close proximity. To explore the underlying molecular mechanisms, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the model parameters such as diffusion coefficient, mutation strength and feedback strength. {\textless}h3{\textgreater}Conclusions{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} Our simulations show that Dkk concentration is elevated in the presence of a mutant cell. However, the impact of these elevated Dkk levels on wild-type hepatocytes is confined in space and magnitude.

	abstract = {In this work, we implement approximate Bayesian computational methods to improve the design of a wound-healing assay used to quantify cell–cell interactions. This is important as cell–cell interactions, such as adhesion and repulsion, have been shown to play a role in cell migration. Initially, we demonstrate with a model of an unrealistic experiment that we are able to identify model parameters that describe agent motility and adhesion, given we choose appropriate summary statistics for our model data. Following this, we replace our model of an unrealistic experiment with a model representative of a practically realisable experiment. We demonstrate that, given the current (and commonly used) experimental set-up, our model parameters cannot be accurately identified using approximate Bayesian computation methods. We compare new experimental designs through simulation, and show more accurate identification of model parameters is possible by expanding the size of the domain upon which the experiment is performed, as opposed to increasing the number of experimental replicates. The results presented in this work, therefore, describe time and cost-saving alterations for a commonly performed experiment for identifying cell motility parameters. Moreover, this work will be of interest to those concerned with performing experiments that allow for the accurate identification of parameters governing cell migratory processes, especially cell migratory processes in which cell–cell adhesion or repulsion are known to play a significant role. Cell motility is a central process in wound healing and relies on complex cell-cell interactions. A team of mathematicians led by Ruth Baker and Kit Yates at the University of Oxford utilised computer simulations to re-design wound-healing assays that efficiently identify cell motility parameters. New experimental designs through computer simulation can more accurately identify cell motility parameters by expanding the size of the domain upon which the experiment is performed, as opposed to increasing the number of experimental replicates. The results describe time and cost-saving alterations for an experimental method for evaluate complex cell-cell interactions.},

Even symmetrically dividing cells can then by chance produce daughters with very different composition. The size of the errors depends on the segregation mechanism: Control systems can reduce low-abundance errors, but the segregation process can also be subject to upstream sources of randomness or spatial heterogeneities that create large errors despite high abundances. Here we mathematically demonstrate how partitioning errors arise for different types of segregation mechanisms and how errors can be greatly increased by upstream heterogeneity but remarkably hard to avoid through controlled partitioning. We also show that seemingly straightforward experiments cannot be straightforwardly interpreted because very different mechanisms produce identical fits and present an approach to deal with this problem by adding binomial counting noise and testing for convexity or concavity in the partitioning error as a function of the binomial thinning parameter. The results lay a conceptual groundwork for more effective studies of heterogeneity among growing and dividing cells, whether in microbes or in differentiating tissues.},

	abstract = {Signaling from the c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase is associated with progression and metastasis of epithelial tumors. c-Met, the receptor for hepatocyte growth factor, triggers epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of cultured cells, which is thought to drive migration of tumor cells and confer on them critical stem cell properties. Here, we employ mathematical modeling to better understand how EMT affects population dynamics in metastatic tumors. We find that without intervention, micrometastatic tumors reach a steady-state population. While the rates of proliferation, senescence and death only have subtle effects on the steady state, changes in the frequency of EMT dramatically alter population dynamics towards exponential growth. We also find that therapies targeting cell proliferation or cell death are markedly more successful when combined with one that prevents EMT, though such therapies do little when used alone. Stochastic modeling reveals the probability of tumor recurrence from small numbers of residual differentiated tumor cells. EMT events in metastatic tumors provide a plausible mechanism by which clinically detectable tumors can arise from dormant micrometastatic tumors. Modeling the dynamics of this process demonstrates the benefit of a treatment that eradicates tumor cells and reduces the rate of EMT simultaneously.},

Here, we quantified the migration patterns of individual fibrosarcoma cells on 2D substrates and in 3D collagen matrices and found that 3D migration does not follow a random walk. Both 2D and 3D migration features a non-Gaussian, exponential mean cell velocity distribution, which we show is primarily a result of cell-to-cell variations. Unlike in the 2D case, 3D cell migration is anisotropic: velocity profiles display different speed and self-correlation processes in different directions, rendering the classical persistent random walk (PRW) model of cell migration inadequate. By incorporating cell heterogeneity and local anisotropy to the PRW model, we predict 3D cell motility over a wide range of matrix densities, which identifies density-independent emerging migratory properties. This analysis also reveals the unexpected robust relation between cell speed and persistence of migration over a wide range of matrix densities.},

	abstract = {The instructions that a cell needs to build proteins are encoded within its genes. To make proteins, these instructions are first copied into molecules of messenger RNA (or mRNA for short). Molecular machines called ribosomes then translate these mRNA molecules to produce proteins. Controlling when and where proteins are produced within a cell is important for tissue development, memory formation in the brain, and the outcome of certain cancers. Methods that can pinpoint the time and place that translation occurs will lead to an improved understanding of how biological processes take place. While current techniques can be used to track the movement of single mRNA molecules in individual cells, it has not yet been possible to determine whether ribosomes are actively translating these mRNAs. Katz, English et al. tracked the movements of mRNA molecules (that encode a protein called $\beta$-actin) and ribosomes at the same time, by using fluorescent tags with different colors. $\beta$-actin is an important component of the cell’s internal scaffolding and its localized translation enables cells to move in a given direction. Katz, English et al. confirmed that $\beta$-actin mRNA translation most often occurs near the leading edge of a moving cell, especially near sites where the cell attaches to its surroundings to help pull itself forward. The experiments also revealed that mRNAs that are being translated behaved differently to mRNAs that are not being translated. In particular, translating mRNAs and their associated ribosomes move much slower than non-translating mRNAs. Importantly, this method can be applied to any mRNA of interest, and once the movements of the mRNA have been defined it is possible to estimate whether or not it is being translated. In the future, a similar approach could provide a definitive answer concerning how mRNA molecules interact with proteins within different parts of the cell and will lead to future investigations on localized production of proteins in living cells.},

We show that such feedback circuits are inherently unstable to mutants that misread the signal level: Mutants have a growth advantage to take over the tissue, and cannot be eliminated by known cell-intrinsic mechanisms. To resolve this, we propose that tissues have biphasic responses in and the signal is toxic at both high and low levels, such as glucotoxicity of beta cells, excitotoxicity in neurons, and toxicity of growth factors to T cells. This gives most of these mutants a frequency-dependent selective disadvantage, which leads to their elimination. However, the biphasic mechanisms create a new unstable fixed point in the feedback circuit beyond which runaway processes can occur, leading to risk of diseases such as diabetes and neurodegenerative disease. Hence, glucotoxicity, which is a dangerous cause of diabetes, may have a protective anti-mutant effect. Biphasic responses in tissues may provide an evolutionary stable strategy that avoids invasion by commonly occurring mutants, but at the same time cause vulnerability to disease. ![][1]{\textless}/img{\textgreater} Tissue homeostasis feedback circuits are inherently susceptible to mis-sensing mutants.

	abstract = {The nuclear localization of specific proteins is critical for cellular processes such as cell division, and in recent years perturbation of the nuclear transport cycle of key proteins has been linked to cancer. In particular, specific gene mutations can alter nuclear transport of tumor suppressing and oncogenic proteins, leading to cell transformation or cancer progression. This review will focus on one such factor, $\beta$-catenin, a key mediator of the canonical wnt signaling pathway. In response to a wnt stimulus or specific gene mutations, $\beta$-catenin is stabilized and translocates to the nucleus where it binds TCF/LEF-1 transcription factors to transactivate genes that drive tumor formation. Moreover, the nuclear import and accumulation of $\beta$-catenin correlates with clinical tumor grade. Recent evidence suggests that the primary nuclear transport route of $\beta$-catenin is independent of the classical Ran/importin import machinery, and that $\beta$-catenin directly contacts the nuclear pore complex to self-regulate its own entry into the nucleus. Here we propose that the $\beta$-catenin nuclear import pathway may provide an opportunity for identification of specific drug targets and inhibition of $\beta$-catenin nuclear function, much like the current screening of drugs that block binding of $\beta$-catenin to LEF-1/TCFs. Here we will discuss the diverse mechanisms regulating nuclear localization of $\beta$-catenin and their potential as targets for anticancer agent development.},

	abstract = {An animal’s ability to rapidly and efficiently locate new sources of food in its environment can mean the difference between life and death. As a result, animals have evolved foraging strategies that are adapted to the distribution and detectability of food sources. Organisms ranging from bacteria to humans use one such strategy, called random search, to locate food that cannot be detected at a distance and that is randomly distributed in their surroundings. The biological mechanisms that underpin random search are relatively well understood in single-cell organisms such as bacteria, but this information tells us little about the mechanisms that are used by animals, which use their nervous system to control their foraging behavior. Roberts et al. have now investigated the biological basis for random search behavior in a tiny roundworm called Caenorhabditis elegans. This worm forages for pockets of bacteria in decaying plant matter and has a simple and well-understood nervous system. Roberts et al. used information on how the cells in this worm’s nervous system connect together into so-called “neural circuits” to generate a mathematical model of random searching. The model revealed that the worm’s neural circuitry for random searching can be understood in terms of two groups of neuron-like components that switch randomly between “ON” and “OFF” states. While one group promotes forward movement, the other promotes backward movement, which is associated with a change in search direction. These two groups inhibit each other so that only one group usually is active at a given time. By adjusting this model to reproduce the behavioral records of real worms searching for food, Roberts et al. could predict the key neuronal connections involved. These predictions were then confirmed by taking electrical recordings from neurons. The model could also account for the unexpected behavioral effects that are seen when a neuron in one of these groups was destroyed or altered by a genetic mutation. These findings thus reveal a biological mechanism for random search behavior in worms that might operate in other animals as well. The findings might also provide future insight into the neural circuits involved in sleep and wakefulness in mammals, which is organized in a similar way.},

The resulting phase diagrams predict that the ratio of XIAP to pro-caspase-3 concentrations plays a key regulatory role: type I behavior predominates when the ratio is low and type II behavior when the ratio is high. Cell-to-cell variability in phenotype is observed when the ratio is close to the type I versus II boundary. By positioning multiple tumor cell lines on the phase diagram we confirm these predictions. We also extend phase space analysis to mutations affecting the rate of caspase-3 ubiquitylation by XIAP, predicting and showing that such mutations abolish all-or-none control over activation of effector caspases. Thus, phase diagrams derived from Lyapunov exponent analysis represent a means to study multi-factorial control over a complex biochemical pathway.},

	abstract = {Variability in gene expression contributes to phenotypic heterogeneity even in isogenic populations. Here, we used the stereotyped, Wnt signaling-dependent development of the Caenorhabditis elegans Q neuroblast to probe endogenous mechanisms that control gene expression variability. We found that the key Hox gene that orients Q neuroblast migration exhibits increased gene expression variability in mutants in which Wnt pathway activity has been perturbed. Distinct features of the gene expression distributions prompted us on a systematic search for regulatory interactions, revealing a network of interlocked positive and negative feedback loops. Interestingly, positive feedback appeared to cooperate with negative feedback to reduce variability while keeping the Hox gene expression at elevated levels. A minimal model correctly predicts the increased gene expression variability across mutants. Our results highlight the influence of gene network architecture on expression variability and implicate feedback regulation as an effective mechanism to ensure developmental robustness.},

	abstract = {The accumulation of somatic mutations, to which the cellular genome is permanently exposed, often leads to cancer. Analysis of any tumour shows that, besides the malignant cells, one finds other 'supporting' cells such as fibroblasts, immune cells of various types and even blood vessels. Together, these cells generate the microenvironment that enables the malignant cell population to grow and ultimately lead to disease. Therefore, understanding the dynamics of tumour growth and response to therapy is incomplete unless the interactions between the malignant cells and normal cells are investigated in the environment in which they take place. The complex interactions between cells in such an ecosystem result from the exchange of information in the form of cytokines- and adhesion-dependent interactions. Such processes impose costs and benefits to the participating cells that may be conveniently recast in the form of a game pay-off matrix. As a result, tumour progression and dynamics can be described in terms of evolutionary game theory (EGT), which provides a convenient framework in which to capture the frequency-dependent nature of ecosystem dynamics. Here, we provide a tutorial review of the central aspects of EGT, establishing a relation with the problem of cancer. Along the way, we also digress on fitness and of ways to compute it. Subsequently, we show how EGT can be applied to the study of the various manifestations and dynamics of multiple myeloma bone disease and its preceding condition known as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. We translate the complex biochemical signals into costs and benefits of different cell types, thus defining a game pay-off matrix. Then we use the well-known properties of the EGT equations to reduce the number of core parameters that characterize disease evolution. Finally, we provide an interpretation of these core parameters in terms of what their function is in the ecosystem we are describing and generate predictions on the type and timing of interventions that can alter the natural history of these two conditions.},

	abstract = {Using a retrovirus-mediated cDNA expression cloning approach, we identified the grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2) transcription factor as novel protooncogene. Overexpression of GRHL2 in NIH3T3 cells induced striking morphological changes, an increase in cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and tumor growth in vivo. By combining a microarray analysis and a phylogenetic footprinting analysis with various biochemical assays, we identified the epidermal growth factor receptor family member Erbb3 as a novel GRHL2 target gene. In breast cancer cell lines, shRNA-mediated knockdown of GRHL2 expression or functional inactivation of GRHL2 using dominant negative GRHL2 proteins induces down-regulation of ERBB3 gene expression, a striking reduction in cell proliferation, and morphological and phenotypical alterations characteristic of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), thus implying contradictory roles of GRHL2 in breast carcinogenesis. Interestingly, we could further demonstrate that expression of GRHL2 is directly suppressed by the transcription factor zinc finger enhancer-binding protein 1 (ZEB1), which in turn is a direct target for repression by GRHL2, suggesting that the EMT transcription factors GRHL2 and ZEB1 form a double negative regulatory feedback loop in breast cancer cells. Finally, a comprehensive immunohistochemical analysis of GRHL2 expression in primary breast cancers showed loss of GRHL2 expression at the invasive front of primary tumors. A pathophysiological relevance of GRHL2 in breast cancer metastasis is further demonstrated by our finding of a statistically significant association between loss of GRHL2 expression in primary breast cancers and lymph node metastasis. We thus demonstrate a crucial role of GRHL2 in breast carcinogenesis.},

	abstract = {To maintain lifelong production of blood cells, haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are tightly regulated by inherent programs and extrinsic regulatory signals received from their microenvironmental niche. Long-term repopulating HSCs reside in several, perhaps overlapping, niches that produce regulatory molecules and signals necessary for homeostasis and for increased output after stress or injury. Despite considerable advances in the specific cellular or molecular mechanisms governing HSC-niche interactions, little is known about the regulatory function in the intact mammalian haematopoietic niche. Recently, we and others described a positive regulatory role for prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) on HSC function ex vivo. Here we show that inhibition of endogenous PGE2 by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) treatment in mice results in modest HSC egress from the bone marrow. Surprisingly, this was independent of the SDF-1-CXCR4 axis implicated in stem-cell migration. Stem and progenitor cells were found to have differing mechanisms of egress, with HSC transit to the periphery dependent on niche attenuation and reduction in the retentive molecule osteopontin. Haematopoietic grafts mobilized with NSAIDs had superior repopulating ability and long-term engraftment. Treatment of non-human primates and healthy human volunteers confirmed NSAID-mediated egress in other species. PGE2 receptor knockout mice demonstrated that progenitor expansion and stem/progenitor egress resulted from reduced E-prostanoid 4 (EP4) receptor signalling. These results not only uncover unique regulatory roles for EP4 signalling in HSC retention in the niche, but also define a rapidly translatable strategy to enhance transplantation therapeutically.},

	abstract = {Embryonic epithelia achieve complex morphogenetic movements, including in-plane reshaping, bending and folding, through the coordinated action and rearrangement of individual cells. Technical advances in molecular and live-imaging studies of epithelial dynamics provide a very real opportunity to understand how cell-level processes facilitate these large-scale tissue rearrangements. However, the large datasets that we are now able to generate require careful interpretation. In combination with experimental approaches, computational modelling allows us to challenge and refine our current understanding of epithelial morphogenesis and to explore experimentally intractable questions. To this end, a variety of cell-based modelling approaches have been developed to describe cell–cell mechanical interactions, ranging from vertex and ‘finite-element’ models that approximate each cell geometrically by a polygon representing the cell's membrane, to immersed boundary and subcellular element models that allow for more arbitrary cell shapes. Here, we review how these models have been used to provide insights into epithelial morphogenesis and describe how such models could help future efforts to decipher the forces and mechanical and biochemical feedbacks that guide cell and tissue-level behaviour. In addition, we discuss current challenges associated with using computational models of morphogenetic processes in a quantitative and predictive way.

	abstract = {In the mouse, over the last 20 years, a set of cell-surface markers and activities have been identified, enabling the isolation of bone marrow (BM) populations highly enriched in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). These HSCs have the ability to generate multiple lineages and are capable of long-term self-renewal activity such that they are able to reconstitute and maintain a functional hematopoietic system after transplantation into lethally irradiated recipients. Using single-cell reconstitution assays, various marker combinations can be used to achieve a functional HSC purity of almost 50\%. Here we have used the differential expression of six of these markers (Sca1, c-Kit, CD135, CD48, CD150, and CD34) on lineage-depleted BM to refine cell hierarchies within the HSC population. At the top of the hierarchy, we propose a dormant HSC population (Lin(-)Sca1(+)c-Kit(+) CD48(-)CD150(+)CD34(-)) that gives rise to an active self-renewing CD34(+) HSC population. HSC dormancy, as well as the balance between self-renewal and differentiation activity, is at least, in part, controlled by the stem cell niches individual HSCs are attached to. Here we review the current knowledge about HSC niches and propose that dormant HSCs are located in niches at the endosteum, whereas activated HSCs are in close contact to sinusoids of the BM microvasculature.},

Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) represents a prime example of such plasticity where an epithelial cell is converted into a mesenchymal cell. This process is used in normal development to generate crucial cell types, and is hijacked by cancer cells for invasion and metastasis. Recent studies also suggest the importance of EMT in generating stem cell properties. The reversibility of EMT and its sensitivity to varying environmental stimuli pose interesting challenges to understand the intricate regulatory networks that direct cellular state transitions and their dynamics. Here we use a systems biology approach to probe into the complexity of the EMT process. We report a new molecular regulation that expands the known regulatory network, and show that this new network is capable of generating multiple intermediate states, which we provide experimental evidence for. We present modeling and experimental results to highlight the significance of a delicate balance between EMT-promoting and -inhibiting factors for achieving and/or selecting an intermediate state, and to suggest the biological significance of the multiple intermediate states.

I finally discuss some "black boxes" regarding neoblasts which still baffle us, namely their phylogenetic and ontogenetic origins, their role in body size control, how their pool is regulated during growth and degrowth, the logic of their proliferative control, and some 'old' long-sought missing tools.},

These strict upper and lower bounds are based on a finite state projection approach, and they converge monotonically to the exact likelihood value. These bounds allow one to discriminate rigorously between models and with a minimum level of computational effort.

Unlike chromosomes or macromolecules, mitochondria and nucleoids are distributed in proportion to the volume of cytoplasm received by each daughter cell. Partitioning errors are kept low by even distribution of the mitochondrial volume and roughly equal spacing of the nucleoids before they are distributed. Science , this issue p.

In particular, we determine how the domain size, aspect ratio and initial vascular network influence the tumour's growth dynamics and its long-time composition. We establish whether it is possible to extrapolate simulation results obtained for small domains to larger ones, by constructing a large simulation domain from a number of identical subdomains, each subsystem initially comprising two parallel parent vessels, with associated cells and diffusible substances. We find that the subsystem is not representative of the full domain and conclude that, for this initial vessel geometry, interactions between adjacent subsystems contribute to the overall growth dynamics. We then show that extrapolation of results from a small subdomain to a larger domain can only be made if the subdomain is sufficiently large and is initialised with a sufficiently complex vascular network. Motivated by these results, we perform simulations to investigate the tumour's response to therapy and show that the probability of tumour elimination in a larger domain can be extrapolated from simulation results on a smaller domain. Finally, we demonstrate how our model may be combined with experimental data, to predict the spatio-temporal evolution of a vascular tumour.},

Whereas these studies note the accepted proximal role of autonomic nervous system balance in HRV patterns, the responsible deeper physiological, clinically relevant mechanisms have not been fully explained. Using mathematical tools from control theory, we combine mechanistic models of basic physiology with experimental exercise data from healthy human subjects to explain causal relationships among states of stress vs. health, HR control, and HRV, and more importantly, the physiologic requirements and constraints underlying these relationships. Nonlinear dynamics play an important explanatory role–most fundamentally in the actuator saturations arising from unavoidable tradeoffs in robust homeostasis and metabolic efficiency. These results are grounded in domain-specific mechanisms, tradeoffs, and constraints, but they also illustrate important, universal properties of complex systems. We show that the study of complex biological phenomena like HRV requires a framework which facilitates inclusion of diverse domain specifics (e.g., due to physiology, evolution, and measurement technology) in addition to general theories of efficiency, robustness, feedback, dynamics, and supporting mathematical tools.},

	abstract = {The role of historical contingency in evolution has been much debated, but rarely tested. Twelve initially identical populations of Escherichia coli were founded in 1988 to investigate this issue. They have since evolved in a glucose-limited medium that also contains citrate, which E. coli cannot use as a carbon source under oxic conditions. No population evolved the capacity to exploit citrate for {\textgreater}30,000 generations, although each population tested billions of mutations. A citrate-using (Cit+) variant finally evolved in one population by 31,500 generations, causing an increase in population size and diversity. The long-delayed and unique evolution of this function might indicate the involvement of some extremely rare mutation. Alternately, it may involve an ordinary mutation, but one whose physical occurrence or phenotypic expression is contingent on prior mutations in that population. We tested these hypotheses in experiments that "replayed" evolution from different points in that population's history. We observed no Cit+ mutants among 8.4 x 10(12) ancestral cells, nor among 9 x 10(12) cells from 60 clones sampled in the first 15,000 generations. However, we observed a significantly greater tendency for later clones to evolve Cit+, indicating that some potentiating mutation arose by 20,000 generations. This potentiating change increased the mutation rate to Cit+ but did not cause generalized hypermutability. Thus, the evolution of this phenotype was contingent on the particular history of that population. More generally, we suggest that historical contingency is especially important when it facilitates the evolution of key innovations that are not easily evolved by gradual, cumulative selection.},

	abstract = {All cells in your body contain the same genetic information in the form of genes encoded within DNA. Yet, cells use this information in different ways so that the activities of individual genes within that DNA can vary from cell to cell. This allows identical cells to become different to each other and to adapt to changing circumstances. A group of proteins called transcription factors control the activity of certain genes by binding to specific sites on DNA. However, this isn’t a straightforward process because DNA in human and other animal cells is usually associated with structures called nucleosomes that can block access to the DNA. Pioneer transcription factors, such as OCT4, are a specific group of transcription factors that can attach to DNA in spite of the nucleosomes, but it’s not clear how this is possible. Once pioneer transcription factors attach to DNA they can help other transcription factors to bind alongside them. King et al. studied OCT4 in stem cells from mouse embryos to investigate how it is able to act as a pioneer transcription factor and control gene activity. The experiments show that several other transcription factors lose the ability to bind to DNA when OCT4 is absent. This leads to widespread changes in gene activity in the cells, which seems to be due to other transcription factors being unable to get past the nucleosomes to attach to the DNA. Further experiments showed that OCT4 needs a protein called BRG1 in order to act as a pioneer transcription factor. BRG1 is an enzyme that is able to move and remove (remodel) nucleosomes attached to DNA, suggesting that normal transcription factor binding requires this activity. The next challenge is to investigate whether BRG1, or similar enzymes, are also needed by other pioneer transcription factors that are required for normal gene activity and cell identity. This will be important because many enzymes that remodel nucleosomes are disrupted in human diseases like cancer where cells lose their normal identity.},

Single-cell culture showed that {\textgreater}40\% of CD34-KSL cells could form neutrophil (n)/macrophage (m)/erythroblast (E)/megakaryocyte (M) (nmEM) colonies. Assuming that a substantial portion of long-term repopulating cells can be detected as nmEM cells within this population, we compared differentiation potentials between individual pairs of daughter and granddaughter cells derived in vitro from single nmEM cells. One of the two daughter or granddaughter cells remained an nmEM cell. The other showed a variety of combinations of differentiation potential. In particular, an nmEM cell directly gave rise, after one cell division, to progenitor cells committed to nm, EM, or M lineages. The probability of asymmetric division of nmEM cells depended on the cytokines used. These data strongly suggest that lineage commitment takes place asymmetrically at the level of HSCs under the influence of external factors.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION:Single-cell technologies have recently gained popularity in cellular differentiation studies regarding their ability to resolve potential heterogeneities in cell populations. Analyzing such high-dimensional single-cell data has its own statistical and computational challenges. Popular multivariate approaches are based on data normalization, followed by dimension reduction and clustering to identify subgroups. However, in the case of cellular differentiation, we would not expect clear clusters to be present but instead expect the cells to follow continuous branching lineages. RESULTS:Here, we propose the use of diffusion maps to deal with the problem of defining differentiation trajectories. We adapt this method to single-cell data by adequate choice of kernel width and inclusion of uncertainties or missing measurement values, which enables the establishment of a pseudotemporal ordering of single cells in a high-dimensional gene expression space. We expect this output to reflect cell differentiation trajectories, where the data originates from intrinsic diffusion-like dynamics. Starting from a pluripotent stage, cells move smoothly within the transcriptional landscape towards more differentiated states with some stochasticity along their path. We demonstrate the robustness of our method with respect to extrinsic noise (e.g. measurement noise) and sampling density heterogeneities on simulated toy data as well as two single-cell quantitative polymerase chain reaction datasets (i.e. mouse haematopoietic stem cells and mouse embryonic stem cells) and an RNA-Seq data of human pre-implantation embryos. We show that diffusion maps perform considerably better than Principal Component Analysis and are advantageous over other techniques for non-linear dimension reduction such as t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding for preserving the global structures and pseudotemporal ordering of cells.

	doi = {10.7554/eLife.25861},
	abstract = {Animals start life as clumps of cells that ultimately give rise to complex structures and organs. Over a century of research has revealed a small number of proteins that are crucial for complex structures to form from these clumps, including one protein called BMP. Different levels of BMP instruct cells to give rise to different tissues. In zebrafish, BMP is more abundant on one side of the embryo than the other. This gradient in BMP levels causes different tissues to form at distinct positions and helps coordinate embryo development. Several theories have been proposed to explain how the BMP gradient is established. They all suggest that a second protein – Chordin – plays an important role in influencing how cells sense the BMP gradient by blocking BMP’s activity. However, the exact role of Chordin in the formation of the BMP gradient is disputed. To address this, Pomreinke, Soh, Rogers et al. directly tested five theories of how BMP and Chordin molecules spread through embryos. The experiments used microscopy to track the movements of fluorescent versions of both molecules in zebrafish embryos. The measurements contradict one theory stating that BMP does not move, and another in which Chordin increases the mobility of BMP. Pomreinke, Soh, Rogers et al. also found that embryos that lack Chordin have increased BMP signaling levels only on the side where Chordin is normally made but not on the opposite side where BMP is made, ruling out several of the theories. The findings are most consistent with the idea that the BMP gradient forms mainly as a result of higher production of BMP on one side of the embryo combined with movement of BMP away from where it is made. Chordin produced at the opposite end of the embryo helps to ensure that only the correct cells receive instructions from BMP. In the future, two approaches could further clarify how the BMP gradient is formed. First, better techniques to directly observe the BMP gradient in normally developing embryos would be useful. Second, new theories that take into account additional players other than BMP and Chordin might help explain some features of development that current theories cannot address. Uncovering the mechanisms that control the formation of BMP gradients will improve our understanding of how clumps of cells can develop into animals.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Many tumors are hierarchically organized and driven by a subpopulation of tumor-initiating cells (TIC), or cancer stem cells. TICs are uniquely capable of recapitulating the tumor and are thought to be highly resistant to radio- and chemotherapy. Macroscopic patterns of tumor expansion before treatment and tumor regression during treatment are tied to the dynamics of TICs. Until now, the quantitative information about the fraction of TICs from macroscopic tumor burden trajectories could not be inferred. In this study, we generated a quantitative method based on a mathematical model that describes hierarchically organized tumor dynamics and patient-derived tumor burden information. The method identifies two characteristic equilibrium TIC regimes during expansion and regression. We show that tumor expansion and regression curves can be leveraged to infer estimates of the TIC fraction in individual patients at detection and after continued therapy. Furthermore, our method is parameter-free; it solely requires the knowledge of a patient9s tumor burden over multiple time points to reveal microscopic properties of the malignancy. We demonstrate proof of concept in the case of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), wherein our model recapitulated the clinical history of the disease in two independent patient cohorts. On the basis of patient-specific treatment responses in CML, we predict that after one year of targeted treatment, the fraction of TICs increases 100-fold and continues to increase up to 1,000-fold after 5 years of treatment. Our novel framework may significantly influence the implementation of personalized treatment strategies and has the potential for rapid translation into the clinic. \textit{Cancer Res; 76(7); 1705–13. ©2016 AACR}.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In both in vitro cyst models and in developing epithelial structures in vivo, epithelial growth could take place close to or far from mechanical equilibrium, and was determined by the hierarchy of time-scales of cell division, cell-cell rearrangements, and lumen dynamics. Equilibrium properties could be inferred by the analysis of cell-cell contact topologies, and the nonequilibrium phenotype was altered by inhibiting ROCK activity. The occurrence of an aberrant multilumen phenotype was linked to fast nonequilibrium growth, even when geometric control of cell division was correctly enforced. We predicted and verified experimentally that slowing down cell division partially rescued a multilumen phenotype induced by altered polarity.

We quantitatively analyze how the activation of oncogenic K-ras in individual Lgr5(+) stem cells accelerates their cell division rate and creates a biased drift towards crypt clonality. K-ras mutant crypts then clonally expand within the epithelium through enhanced crypt fission, which distributes the existing Paneth cell niche over the two new crypts. Thus, an unequal competition between wild-type and mutant intestinal stem cells initiates a biased drift that leads to the clonal expansion of crypts carrying oncogenic mutations.},

	abstract = {Cancer chemotherapy efficacy is frequently impaired by either intrinsic or acquired tumor resistance. A fundamental problem in cancer research is identifying the cell type that is capable of sustaining neoplastic growth and its origin from normal tissue cells. In recent years, the cancer stem cell (CSC) theory has changed the classical view of tumor growth and therefore the therapeutic perspective. Overcoming intrinsic and acquired resistance of cancer stem/progenitor cells to current clinical treatments represents a major challenge in treating and curing the most aggressive and metastatic cancers. On the other hand, the identification of CSCs in vivo and in vitro relies on specific surface markers that should allow the sorting cancer cells into phenotypically distinct subpopulations. In the present review, recent papers published on CSCs in solid tumors (breast, prostate, brain and melanoma) are discussed, highlighting critical points such as the choice of markers to sort CSCs and mouse models to demonstrate that CSCs are able to replicate the original tumor. A discussion of the possible role of aldehyde dehydrogenase and CXCR6 biomarkers as signaling molecules in CSCs and normal stem cells is also discussed. The author believes that efforts have to be made to investigate the functional and biological properties of putative CSCs in cancer. Developing diagnostic/prognostic tools to follow cancer development is also a challenge. In this connection it would be useful to develop a multidisciplinary approach combining mathematics, physics and biology which merges experimental approaches and theory. Biological models alone are probably unable to resolve the problem completely.},

The molecular machinery that facilitates such a signalling is, however, only understood in outline. In particular the functional relevance of the dimerization of a non-orthodox or hybrid histidine kinase along which the phosphorelay takes place has been a subject of debate. We use a combination of molecular and genetic approaches, coupled to mathematical and statistical modelling, to demonstrate that the different possible intra- and inter-molecular mechanisms of phosphotransfer are formally non-identifiable in Escherichia coli expressing the ArcB non-orthodox histidine kinase used in anoxic redox control. In order to resolve this issue we further analyse the mathematical model in order to identify discriminatory experiments, which are then performed to address cis- and trans-phosphorelay mechanisms. The results suggest that exclusive cis- and trans-mechanisms will not be operating, instead the functional phosphorelay is likely to build around a sequence of allosteric interactions among the domain pairs in the histidine kinase. This is the first detailed mechanistic analysis of the molecular processes involved in non-orthodox two-component signalling and our results suggest strongly that dimerization facilitates more discriminatory proof-reading of external signals, via these allosteric reactions, prior to them being further processed.},

Yet, many cases exist where individual cells in the same environment behave very differently, despite sharing the same genes. This creates a problem when we try to explain the behavior of a cell population based on the genes these cells carry. For example, it is difficult to predict how fast the overall number of cells increases based on the genes they all carry if some cells divide much faster than others. We addressed this problem using a synthetic gene circuit that could randomly allocate cells into drug resistant and drug sensitive states. We could control the fractions of cells and the time they resided in these states by adding an inducer to the growth solution. After measuring how fast cells transitioned between these two states, and how fast they grew in inducer and drug alone, we predicted computationally how fast they should grow when both inducer and drug are present. We validated experimentally these predictions and found a “sweet spot” of drug resistance where cells grew fastest in the presence of drugs.},

The number of preserved primate species discovered in the fossil record, along with their geological age distribution, is combined with the number of extant primate species to provide initial estimates of the primate and anthropoid divergence times. This is done by using a stochastic forwards-modeling approach where speciation and fossil preservation and discovery are simulated forward in time. We use the posterior distribution from the fossil analysis as a prior distribution on node ages in a molecular analysis. Sequence data from two genomic regions (CFTR on human chromosome 7 and the CYP7A1 region on chromosome 8) from 15 primate species are used with the birth-death model implemented in mcmctree in PAML to infer the posterior distribution of the ages of 14 nodes in the primate tree. We find that these age estimates are older than previously reported dates for all but one of these nodes. To perform the inference, a new approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) algorithm is introduced, where the structure of the model can be exploited in an ABC-within-Gibbs algorithm to provide a more efficient analysis.},

We show that drift-driven clonal expansions cooperate with faster HSC cycling in young children to produce conditions that are permissive for accumulation of multiple driver mutations in a single cell. Later in life, clonal evolution was suppressed by stabilizing selection in the larger young adult pools, and it was driven by positive selection at advanced ages in the presence of microenvironmental decline. Overall, our results indicate that leukemogenesis is driven by distinct evolutionary forces in children and adults.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:The association of cancer stem cells with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is receiving attention. We found in our previous study that EMT existed from CD24- phenotype cells to their differentiated cells. It was shown that cyclin D1 functioned in sustaining self-renewal independent of CDK4/CDK6 activation, but its effect on the EMT mechanism in ovarian cancer stem cells is unclear. METHODS:The anchorage-independent spheroids from ovarian adenocarcinoma cell line 3AO were formed in a serum-free medium. CD24- and CD24+ cells were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Cell morphology, viability, apoptosis, and migratory ability were observed. Stem-related molecule Bmi-1, Oct-4 and EMT-related marker E-cadherin, and vimentin expressions were analyzed. Cyclin D1 expression in CD24- phenotype enriched spheroids was knocked down with small interfering RNA, and its effects on cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration ability, and EMT-related phenotype after transfection were observed. RESULTS:In our study, CD24- cells presented stronger proliferative, anti-apoptosis capacity, and migratory ability, than CD24+ cells or parental cells. CD24- cells grew with a scattered spindle-shape within 3 days of culture and transformed into a cobblestone-like shape, identical to CD24+ cells or parental cells at 7 days of culture. CD24- cells or spheroids highly expressed cyclin D1, Bmi-1, and vimentin, and seldom expressed E-cadherin, while CD24+ or parental cells showed the opposite expression. Furthermore, cyclin D1-targeted small interfering RNA resulted in decreased vimentin expression in spheroids. Transfected cells also exhibited an obvious decrease in cell viability and migration, but an increase in cell apoptosis. CONCLUSION:Cancer stem cell-like cells possess mesenchymal characteristics and EMT ability, and cyclin D1 involves in EMT mechanism, suggesting that EMT of cancer stem cell-like cells may play a key role in invasion and metastasis of ovarian cancer.},

	abstract = {Within populations of cells, fate decisions are controlled by an indeterminate combination of cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic factors. In the case of stem cells, the stem cell niche is believed to maintain "stemness" through communication and interactions between the stem cells and one or more other cell-types that contribute to the niche conditions. To investigate the robustness of cell fate decisions in the stem cell hierarchy and the role that the niche plays, we introduce simple mathematical models of stem and progenitor cells, their progeny and their interplay in the niche. These models capture the fundamental processes of proliferation and differentiation and allow us to consider alternative possibilities regarding how niche-mediated signalling feedback regulates the niche dynamics. Generalised stability analysis of these stem cell niche systems enables us to describe the stability properties of each model. We find that although the number of feasible states depends on the model, their probabilities of stability in general do not: stem cell–niche models are stable across a wide range of parameters. We demonstrate that niche-mediated feedback increases the number of stable steady states, and show how distinct cell states have distinct branching characteristics. The ecological feedback and interactions mediated by the stem cell niche thus lend (surprisingly) high levels of robustness to the stem and progenitor cell population dynamics. Furthermore, cell–cell interactions are sufficient for populations of stem cells and their progeny to achieve stability and maintain homeostasis. We show that the robustness of the niche – and hence of the stem cell pool in the niche – depends only weakly, if at all, on the complexity of the niche make-up: simple as well as complicated niche systems are capable of supporting robust and stable stem cell dynamics.},

	abstract = {Recent advances have highlighted extensive phenotypic and functional similarities between normal stem cells and cancer stem cells. This raises the question of whether disease therapies can be developed that eliminate cancer stem cells without eliminating normal stem cells. Here we address this issue by conditionally deleting the Pten tumour suppressor gene in adult haematopoietic cells. This led to myeloproliferative disease within days and transplantable leukaemias within weeks. Pten deletion also promoted haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) proliferation. However, this led to HSC depletion via a cell-autonomous mechanism, preventing these cells from stably reconstituting irradiated mice. In contrast to leukaemia-initiating cells, HSCs were therefore unable to maintain themselves without Pten. These effects were mostly mediated by mTOR as they were inhibited by rapamycin. Rapamycin not only depleted leukaemia-initiating cells but also restored normal HSC function. Mechanistic differences between normal stem cells and cancer stem cells can thus be targeted to deplete cancer stem cells without damaging normal stem cells.},

Since cellular replication is associated with an inherent risk of mutagenesis, tissues are maintained by a small group of stem cells (SCs) that replicate slowly to maintain their own population and that give rise to differentiated cells. There is increasing evidence that many tumors are also maintained by a small population of cancer stem cells that may arise by mutations from normal SCs. SC replication can be either symmetric or asymmetric. The former can lead to expansion of the SC pool. We describe a simple model to evaluate the impact of (a)symmetric SC replication on the expansion of mutant SCs and to show that mutations that increase the probability of asymmetric replication can lead to rapid mutant SC expansion in the absence of a selective fitness advantage. Mutations in several genes can lead to this process and may be at the root of the carcinogenic process.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Despite recent advances in targeted drugs and immunotherapy, cancer remains "the emperor of all maladies" due to inevitable emergence of resistance. Drug resistance is thought to be driven by mutations and/or dynamic plasticity that deregulate pathway activities and regulatory programs of a highly heterogeneous tumour. In this study, we propose a modelling framework to simulate population dynamics of heterogeneous tumour cells with reversible drug resistance. Drug sensitivity of a tumour cell is determined by its internal states, which are demarcated by coordinated activities of multiple interconnected oncogenic pathways. Transitions between cellular states depend on the effects of targeted drugs and regulatory relations between the pathways. Under this framework, we build a simple model to capture drug resistance characteristics of BRAF-mutant melanoma, where two cell states are described by two mutually inhibitory - main and alternative - pathways. We assume that cells with an activated main pathway are proliferative yet sensitive to the BRAF inhibitor, and cells with an activated alternative pathway are quiescent but resistant to the drug. We describe a dynamical process of tumour growth under various drug regimens using the explicit solution of mean-field equations. Based on these solutions, we compare efficacy of three treatment strategies: static treatments with continuous and constant dosages, periodic treatments with regular intermittent phases and drug holidays, and treatments derived from optimal control theory (OCT). Based on these analysis, periodic treatments outperform static treatments with a considerable margin, while treatments based on OCT outperform the best periodic treatment. Our results provide insights regarding optimal cancer treatment modalities for heterogeneous tumours, and may guide the development of optimal therapeutic strategies to circumvent drug resistance and due to tumour plasticity.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here, using individual-based stochastic spatial models, we study the conditions for achieving coexistence on the edge between two habitats, one of which is a bacterial refuge with conditions hostile to phage whereas the other is phage friendly. We show how bacterial density-dependent, or quorum-sensing, mechanisms such as the formation of biofilm can produce such refuges and edges in a self-organized manner. Coexistence on these edges exhibits the following properties, all of which are observed in real phage-bacteria ecosystems but difficult to achieve together in nonspatial ecosystem models: (i) highly efficient virulent phage with relatively long lifetimes, high infection rates and large burst sizes; (ii) large, stable, and high-density populations of phage and bacteria; (iii) a fast turnover of both phage and bacteria; and (iv) stability over evolutionary timescales despite imbalances in the rates of phage vs. bacterial evolution.},

All extant organisms must have evolved suitable sensors, signaling systems, and response mechanisms allowing them to survive under the conditions they are likely to encounter. Here, we investigate in detail the evolutionary history of one such system: The phage shock protein (Psp) stress response system is an important part of the stress response machinery in many bacteria, including Escherichia coli K12. Here, we use a systematic analysis of the genes that make up and regulate the Psp system in E. coli in order to elucidate the evolutionary history of the system. We compare gene sharing, sequence evolution, and conservation of protein-coding as well as noncoding DNA sequences and link these to comparative analyses of genome/operon organization across 698 bacterial genomes. Finally, we evaluate experimentally the biological advantage/disadvantage of a simplified version of the Psp system under different oxygen-related environments. Our results suggest that the Psp system evolved around a core response mechanism by gradually co-opting genes into the system to provide more nuanced sensory, signaling, and effector functionalities. We find that recruitment of new genes into the response machinery is closely linked to incorporation of these genes into a psp operon as is seen in E. coli, which contains the bulk of genes involved in the response. The organization of this operon allows for surprising levels of additional transcriptional control and flexibility. The results discussed here suggest that the components of such signaling systems will only be evolutionarily conserved if the overall functionality of the system can be maintained.},

	abstract = {Branched epithelia determine the anatomy of many mammalian organs; understanding how they develop is therefore an important element of understanding organogenesis as a whole. In recent years, much progress has been made in identifying paracrine factors that regulate branching morphogenesis in many organs, but comparatively little attention has been paid to the mechanisms of morphogenesis that translate these signals into anatomical change. Localized cell proliferation is a potentially powerful mechanism for directing the growth of a developing system to produce a specific final morphology. We have examined the pattern of cell proliferation in the ureteric bud system of the embryonic murine metanephric kidneys developing in culture. We detect a zone of high proliferation at the site of the presumptive ureteric bud even before it emerges from the Wolffian duct and later, as ureteric bud morphogenesis continues, proliferation is localized mainly in the very tips of the branching epithelium. Blocking cell cycling using methotrexate inhibits ureteric bud emergence. The proliferative zone is present at ureteric bud tips only when they are undergoing active morphogenesis; if branching is inhibited either by treatment with natural negative regulators (TGF-beta) or with antagonists of natural positive regulators (GDNF, glycosaminoglycans) then proliferation at the tips falls back to levels characteristic of the stalks behind them. Our results suggest that localized proliferation is an important morphogenetic mechanism in kidney development.},

	abstract = {Cells accomplish the process of fate decisions and form terminal lineages through a series of binary choices in which cells switch stable states from one branch to another as the interacting strengths of regulatory factors continuously vary. Various combinatorial effects may occur because almost all regulatory processes are managed in a combinatorial fashion. Combinatorial regulation is crucial for cell fate decisions because it may effectively integrate many different signaling pathways to meet the higher regulation demand during cell development. However, whether the contribution of combinatorial regulation to the state transition is better than that of a single one and if so, what the optimal combination strategy is, seem to be significant issue from the point of view of both biology and mathematics. Using the approaches of combinatorial perturbations and bifurcation analysis, we provide a general framework for the quantitative analysis of synergism in molecular networks. Different from the known methods, the bifurcation-based approach depends only on stable state responses to stimuli because the state transition induced by combinatorial perturbations occurs between stable states. More importantly, an optimal combinatorial perturbation strategy can be determined by investigating the relationship between the bifurcation curve of a synergistic perturbation pair and the level set of a specific objective function. The approach is applied to two models, i.e., a theoretical multistable decision model and a biologically realistic CREB model, to show its validity, although the approach holds for a general class of biological systems.},

	abstract = {The adult mammalian kidney has a complex, highly-branched collecting duct epithelium that arises as a ureteric bud sidebranch from an epithelial tube known as the nephric duct. Subsequent branching of the ureteric bud to form the collecting duct tree is regulated by subcellular interactions between the epithelium and a population of mesenchymal cells that surround the tips of outgrowing branches. The mesenchymal cells produce glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), that binds with RET receptors on the surface of the epithelial cells to stimulate several subcellular pathways in the epithelium. Such interactions are known to be a prerequisite for normal branching development, although competing theories exist for their role in morphogenesis. Here we introduce the first agent-based model of ex vivo kidney uretic branching. Through comparison with experimental data, we show that growth factor-regulated growth mechanisms can explain early epithelial cell branching, but only if epithelial cell division depends in a switch-like way on the local growth factor concentration; cell division occurring only if the driving growth factor level exceeds a threshold. We also show how a recently-developed method, "Approximate Approximate Bayesian Computation", can be used to infer key model parameters, and reveal the dependency between the parameters controlling a growth factor-dependent growth switch. These results are consistent with a requirement for signals controlling proliferation and chemotaxis, both of which are previously identified roles for GDNF.},

It is incompletely understood how the Axin1 complex exerts its Wnt-regulated function. Here, we examine the mechanism of Wnt signaling under endogenous levels of the Axin1 complex. Our results demonstrate that $\beta$-catenin is not only phosphorylated inside the Axin1 complex, but also ubiquinated and degraded via the proteasome, all within an intact Axin1 complex. In disagreement with current views, we find neither a disassembly of the complex nor an inhibition of phosphorylation of Axin1-bound $\beta$-catenin upon Wnt signaling. Similar observations are made in primary intestinal epithelium and in colorectal cancer cell lines carrying activating Wnt pathway mutations. Wnt signaling suppresses $\beta$-catenin ubiquitination normally occurring within the complex, leading to complex saturation by accumulated phospho-$\beta$-catenin. Subsequently, newly synthesized $\beta$-catenin can accumulate in a free cytosolic form and engage nuclear TCF transcription factors.},

	abstract = {The transition between the proliferation and differentiation of progenitor cells is a key step in organogenesis, and alterations in this process can lead to developmental disorders. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK) signaling pathway is one of the most intensively studied signaling mechanisms that regulates both proliferation and differentiation. How a single molecule (e.g. ERK) can regulate two opposing cellular outcomes is still a mystery. Using both chick and mouse models, we shed light on the mechanism responsible for the switch from proliferation to differentiation of head muscle progenitors and implicate ERK subcellular localization. Manipulation of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-ERK signaling pathway in chick embryos in vitro and in vivo demonstrated that blockage of this pathway accelerated myogenic differentiation, whereas its activation diminished it. We next examined whether the spatial subcellular localization of ERK could act as a switch between proliferation (nuclear ERK) and differentiation (cytoplasmic ERK) of muscle progenitors. A myristoylated peptide that blocks importin 7-mediated ERK nuclear translocation induced robust myogenic differentiation of muscle progenitor/stem cells in both head and trunk. In the mouse, analysis of Sprouty mutant embryos revealed that increased ERK signaling suppressed both head and trunk myogenesis. Our findings, corroborated by mathematical modeling, suggest that ERK shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm provides a switch-like transition between proliferation and differentiation of muscle progenitors.},

	abstract = {Adult blood contains a mixture of mature cell types, each with specialized functions. Single hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have been functionally shown to generate all mature cell types for the lifetime of the organism. Differentiation of HSCs toward alternative lineages must be balanced at the population level by the fate decisions made by individual cells. Transcription factors play a key role in regulating these decisions and operate within organized regulatory programs that can be modeled as transcriptional regulatory networks. As dysregulation of single HSC fate decisions is linked to fatal malignancies such as leukemia, it is important to understand how these decisions are controlled on a cell-by-cell basis. Here we developed and applied a network inference method, exploiting the ability to infer dynamic information from single-cell snapshot expression data based on expression profiles of 48 genes in 2,167 blood stem and progenitor cells. This approach allowed us to infer transcriptional regulatory network models that recapitulated differentiation of HSCs into progenitor cell types, focusing on trajectories toward megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitors and lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitors. By comparing these two models, we identified and subsequently experimentally validated a difference in the regulation of nuclear factor, erythroid 2 (Nfe2) and core-binding factor, runt domain, alpha subunit 2, translocated to, 3 homolog (Cbfa2t3h) by the transcription factor Gata2. Our approach confirms known aspects of hematopoiesis, provides hypotheses about regulation of HSC differentiation, and is widely applicable to other hierarchical biological systems to uncover regulatory relationships.},

	abstract = {Spatial pattern formation is a critical issue in developmental biology. Gene expression boundary sharpening has been observed from both experiments and modeling simulations. However, the mechanism to determine the sharpness of the boundary is not fully elucidated. We investigated the boundary sharpening resulted by three biological motifs, interacting with morphogens, and uncovered their probabilistic landscapes. The landscape view, along with calculated average switching time between attractors, provides a natural explanation for the boundary sharpening behavior relying on the noise induced gene state switchings. To possess boundary sharpening potential, a gene network needs to generate an asymmetric bistable state, i.e. one of the two stable states is less stable than the other. We found that the mutual repressed self-activation model displays more robust boundary sharpening ability against parameter perturbation, compared to the mutual repression or the self-activation model. This is supported by the results of switching time calculated from the landscape, which indicate that the mutual repressed self-activation model has shortest switching time, among three models. Additionally, introducing cross gradients of morphogens provides a more stable mechanism for the boundary sharpening of gene expression, due to a two-way switching mechanism. Our results reveal the underlying principle for the gene expression boundary sharpening, and pave the way for the mechanistic understanding of cell fate decisions in the pattern formation processes of development.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Differentiation of naïve CD4$^{\textrm{+}}$ T cells into functionally distinct T helper (T$_{\textrm{H}}$) subsets is crucial for the orchestration of immune responses. Because of extensive heterogeneity and multiple overlapping transcriptional programs in differentiating T cell populations, this process has remained a challenge for systematic dissection in vivo. By using single-cell transcriptomics and computational analysis with a temporal mixtures of Gaussian processes model, termed GPfates, we reconstructed the developmental trajectories of T$_{\textrm{H}}$1 and T$_{\textrm{FH}}$ (T follicular helper) cells during blood-stage \textit{Plasmodium} infection in mice. By tracking clonality using endogenous T cell receptor sequences, we first demonstrated that T$_{\textrm{H}}$1/T$_{\textrm{FH}}$ bifurcation had occurred at both population and single-clone levels. Next, we identified genes whose expression was associated with T$_{\textrm{H}}$1 or T$_{\textrm{FH}}$ fates and demonstrated a T cell–intrinsic role for Galectin-1 in supporting T$_{\textrm{H}}$1 differentiation. We also revealed the close molecular relationship between T$_{\textrm{H}}$1 and interleukin-10–producing Tr1 cells in this infection. T$_{\textrm{H}}$1 and T$_{\textrm{FH}}$ fates emerged from a highly proliferative precursor that up-regulated aerobic glycolysis and accelerated cell cycling as cytokine expression began. Dynamic gene expression of chemokine receptors around bifurcation predicted roles for cell-cell interaction in driving T$_{\textrm{H}}$1/T$_{\textrm{FH}}$ fates. In particular, we found that precursor T$_{\textrm{H}}$ cells were coached toward a T$_{\textrm{H}}$1 but not a T$_{\textrm{FH}}$ fate by inflammatory monocytes. Thus, by integrating genomic and computational approaches, our study has provided two unique resources: a database, www.PlasmoTH.org, which facilitates discovery of novel factors controlling T$_{\textrm{H}}$1/T$_{\textrm{FH}}$ fate commitment, and, more generally, GPfates, a modeling framework for characterizing cell differentiation toward multiple fates.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Adult stem cells, which exist throughout the body, multiply by cell division to replenish dying cells or to promote regeneration to repair damaged tissues. To perform these functions during the lifetime of organs or tissues, stem cells need to maintain their populations in a faithful distribution of their epigenetic states, which are susceptible to stochastic fluctuations during each cell division, unexpected injury, and potential genetic mutations that occur during many cell divisions. However, it remains unclear how the three processes of differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis in regulating stem cells collectively manage these challenging tasks. Here, without considering molecular details, we propose a genetic optimal control model for adult stem cell regeneration that includes the three fundamental processes, along with cell division and adaptation based on differential fitnesses of phenotypes. In the model, stem cells with a distribution of epigenetic states are required to maximize expected performance after each cell division. We show that heterogeneous proliferation that depends on the epigenetic states of stem cells can improve the maintenance of stem cell distributions to create balanced populations. A control strategy during each cell division leads to a feedback mechanism involving heterogeneous proliferation that can accelerate regeneration with less fluctuation in the stem cell population. When mutation is allowed, apoptosis evolves to maximize the performance during homeostasis after multiple cell divisions. The overall results highlight the importance of cross-talk between genetic and epigenetic regulation and the performance objectives during homeostasis in shaping a desirable heterogeneous distribution of stem cells in epigenetic states.},

Current models of airway epithelial regeneration propose that distinct cytokeratin 8-expressing progenitor cells, arising from p63(+) basal stem cells, subsequently differentiate into secretory and ciliated cell lineages. We now show that immediately following injury, discrete subpopulations of p63(+) airway basal stem/progenitor cells themselves express Notch pathway components associated with either secretory or ciliated cell fate commitment. One basal cell population displays intracellular Notch2 activation and directly generates secretory cells; the other expresses c-myb and directly yields ciliated cells. Furthermore, disrupting Notch ligand activity within the basal cell population at large disrupts the normal pattern of lineage segregation. These non-cell-autonomous effects demonstrate that effective airway epithelial regeneration requires intercellular communication within the broader basal stem/progenitor cell population. These findings have broad implications for understanding epithelial regeneration and stem cell heterogeneity.},

An inherent problem with this approach is that the presence of specific cell surface markers does not directly reflect the transcriptional state of a cell. Here we used a marker-free approach to computationally reconstruct the blood lineage tree in zebrafish and order cells along their differentiation trajectory, based on their global transcriptional differences. Within the population of transcriptionally similar stem and progenitor cells our analysis revealed considerable cell-to-cell differences in their probability to transition to another, committed state. Once fate decision was executed, the suppression of transcription of ribosomal genes and up-regulation of lineage specific factors co-ordinately controlled lineage differentiation. Evolutionary analysis further demonstrated that this haematopoietic program was highly conserved between zebrafish and higher vertebrates.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

They fail to form beating cardiomyocytes, generate neurons poorly, form small, poorly differentiated teratomas, and cannot generate chimeric mice. Upon RA-mediated differentiation, Oct1-deficient cells induce lineage-appropriate developmentally poised genes poorly while lineage-inappropriate genes, including extra-embryonic genes, are aberrantly expressed. In ESCs, Oct1 co-occupies a specific set of targets with Oct4, but does not occupy differentially expressed developmental targets. Instead, Oct1 occupies these targets as cells differentiate and Oct4 declines.

Using a mouse model in which Notch 1 is inactivated in bone marrow (BM) precursors we have shown that B cells instead of T cells are found in the thymus of BM chimeras. However, it is not clear whether these B cells develop by default from a common lymphoid precursor due to the absence of Notch 1 signaling, or whether they arise as a result of perturbed migration of BM-derived B cells and/or altered homeostasis of normal resident thymic B cells. In this report we show that Notch 1-deficient thymic B cells resemble BM B cells in phenotype and turnover kinetics and are located predominantly in the medulla and corticomedullary junction. Peripheral blood lymphocyte analysis shows no evidence of recirculating Notch1(-/)- BM B cells. Furthermore, lack of T cell development is not due to a failure of Notch1(-/)- precursors to home to the thymus, as even after intrathymic reconstitution with BM cells, B cells instead of T cells develop from Notch 1-deficient precursors. Taken together, these results provide evidence for de novo ectopic B cell development in the thymus, and support the hypothesis that in the absence of Notch 1 common lymphoid precursors adopt the default cell fate and develop into B cells instead.},

How much would evolution have to change the parameters of somatic evolution in order to equalize the cancer risk between species that differ by orders of magnitude in size? Analysis of previously published models of colorectal cancer suggests that a two- to three-fold decrease in the mutation rate or stem cell division rate is enough to reduce a whale's cancer risk to that of a human. Similarly, the addition of one to two required tumour-suppressor gene mutations would also be sufficient. We surveyed mammalian genomes and did not find a positive correlation of tumour-suppressor genes with increasing body mass and longevity. However, we found evidence of the amplification of TP53 in elephants, MAL in horses and FBXO31 in microbats, which might explain Peto's paradox in those species. Exploring parameters that evolution may have fine-tuned in large, long-lived organisms will help guide future experiments to reveal the underlying biology responsible for Peto's paradox and guide cancer prevention in humans.},

We observe that interaction between KCNQ1 and KCNE1 (the beta-subunit) confers kinetic properties on IKs that make it suitable for participation in action potential repolarization and its adaptation to rate changes; in particular, the channel develops an available reserve of closed states near the open state that can open rapidly on demand. CONCLUSIONS:Because of its ability to form an available reserve, IKs can function as a repolarization reserve when IKr, the rapid delayed rectifier, is reduced by disease or drug and can prevent excessive action potential prolongation and development of arrhythmogenic early afterdepolarizations.},

In normal mouse hematopoietic stem cells, the process of self-renewal involves the beta-catenin-signaling pathway. We investigated whether leukemic stem cells in CML also use the beta-catenin pathway for self-renewal. METHODS:We used fluorescence-activated cell sorting to isolate hematopoietic stem cells, common myeloid progenitors, granulocyte-macrophage progenitors, and megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors from marrow during several phases of CML and from normal marrow. BCR-ABL, beta-catenin, and LEF-1 transcripts were compared by means of a quantitative reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay in normal and CML hematopoietic stem cells and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors. Confocal fluorescence microscopy and a lymphoid enhancer factor/T-cell factor reporter assay were used to detect nuclear beta-catenin in these cells. In vitro replating assays were used to identify self-renewing cells as candidate leukemic stem cells, and the dependence of self-renewal on beta-catenin activation was tested by lentiviral transduction of hematopoietic progenitors with axin, an inhibitor of the beta-catenin pathway. RESULTS:The granulocyte-macrophage progenitor pool from patients with CML in blast crisis and imatinib-resistant CML was expanded, expressed BCR-ABL, and had elevated levels of nuclear beta-catenin as compared with the levels in progenitors from normal marrow. Unlike normal granulocyte-macrophage progenitors, CML granulocyte-macrophage progenitors formed self-renewing, replatable myeloid colonies, and in vitro self-renewal capacity was reduced by enforced expression of axin. CONCLUSIONS:Activation of beta-catenin in CML granulocyte-macrophage progenitors appears to enhance the self-renewal activity and leukemic potential of these cells.},

Wnt signals emanating from the niche can act as self-renewal factors for stem cells in multiple mammalian tissues. Wnt proteins are lipid-modified, which constrains them to act as short-range cellular signals. The locality of Wnt signaling dictates that stem cells exiting the Wnt signaling domain differentiate, spatially delimiting the niche in certain tissues. In some instances, stem cells may act as or generate their own niche, enabling the self-organization of patterned tissues. In this Review, we discuss the various ways by which Wnt operates in stem cell control and, in doing so, identify an integral program for tissue renewal and regeneration.},

	abstract = {{\textless}h2{\textgreater}Abstract{\textless}/h2{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Gene regulatory networks are multistable dynamical systems in which attractor states represent cell phenotypes. Spontaneous, noise-induced transitions between these states are thought to underlie critical cellular processes, including cell developmental fate decisions, phenotypic plasticity in fluctuating environments, and carcinogenesis. As such, there is increasing interest in the development of theoretical and computational approaches that can shed light on the dynamics of these stochastic state transitions in multistable gene networks. We applied a numerical rare-event sampling algorithm to study transition paths of spontaneous noise-induced switching for a ubiquitous gene regulatory network motif, the bistable toggle switch, in which two mutually repressive genes compete for dominant expression. We find that the method can efficiently uncover detailed switching mechanisms that involve fluctuations both in occupancies of DNA regulatory sites and copy numbers of protein products. In addition, we show that the rate parameters governing binding and unbinding of regulatory proteins to DNA strongly influence the switching mechanism. In a regime of slow DNA-binding/unbinding kinetics, spontaneous switching occurs relatively frequently and is driven primarily by fluctuations in DNA-site occupancies. In contrast, in a regime of fast DNA-binding/unbinding kinetics, switching occurs rarely and is driven by fluctuations in levels of expressed protein. Our results demonstrate how spontaneous cell phenotype transitions involve collective behavior of both regulatory proteins and DNA. Computational approaches capable of simulating dynamics over many system variables are thus well suited to exploring dynamic mechanisms in gene networks.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

By contrast, early in gestation, injured fetal tissues can be completely recreated, without fibrosis, in a process resembling regeneration. Some organisms, however, retain the ability to regenerate tissue throughout adult life. Knowledge gained from studying such organisms might help to unlock latent regenerative pathways in humans, which would change medical practice as much as the introduction of antibiotics did in the twentieth century.},

	abstract = {During the first year of life, the brain grows rapidly and the neurocranium increases to about 65\% of its adult size. Our understanding of the relationship between the biomechanical forces, especially from the growing brain, the craniofacial soft tissue structures and the individual bone plates of the skull vault is still limited. This basic knowledge could help in the future planning of craniofacial surgical operations. The aim of this study was to develop a validated computational model of skull growth, based on the finite-element (FE) method, to help understand the biomechanics of skull growth. To do this, a two-step validation study was carried out. First, an in vitro physical three-dimensional printed model and an in silico FE model were created from the same micro-CT scan of an infant skull and loaded with forces from the growing brain from zero to two months of age. The results from the in vitro model validated the FE model before it was further developed to expand from 0 to 12 months of age. This second FE model was compared directly with in vivo clinical CT scans of infants without craniofacial conditions ( n = 56). The various models were compared in terms of predicted skull width, length and circumference, while the overall shape was quantified using three-dimensional distance plots. Statistical analysis yielded no significant differences between the male skull models. All size measurements from the FE model versus the in vitro physical model were within 5\%, with one exception showing a 7.6\% difference. The FE model and in vivo data also correlated well, with the largest percentage difference in size being 8.3\%. Overall, the FE model results matched well with both the in vitro and in vivo data. With further development and model refinement, this modelling method could be used to assist in preoperative planning of craniofacial surgery procedures and could help to reduce reoperation rates.},

	abstract = {Haematopoiesis is the complex developmental process that maintains the turnover of all blood cell lineages. It critically depends on the correct functioning of rare, quiescent haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and more numerous, HSC-derived, highly proliferative and differentiating haematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). Infection is known to affect HSCs, with severe and chronic inflammatory stimuli leading to stem cell pool depletion, while acute, non-lethal infections exert transient and even potentiating effects. Both whether this paradigm applies to all infections and whether the HSC response is the dominant driver of the changes observed during stressed haematopoiesis remain open questions. We use a mouse model of malaria, based on natural, sporozoite-driven Plasmodium berghei infection, as an experimental platform to gain a global view of haematopoietic perturbations during infection progression. We observe coordinated responses by the most primitive HSCs and multiple HPCs, some starting before blood parasitaemia is detected. We show that, despite highly variable inter-host responses, primitive HSCs become highly proliferative, but mathematical modelling suggests that this alone is not sufficient to significantly impact the whole haematopoietic cascade. We observe that the dramatic expansion of Sca-1(+) progenitors results from combined proliferation of direct HSC progeny and phenotypic changes in downstream populations. We observe that the simultaneous perturbation of HSC/HPC population dynamics is coupled with early signs of anaemia onset. Our data uncover a complex relationship between Plasmodium and its host's haematopoiesis and raise the question whether the variable responses observed may affect the outcome of the infection itself and its long-term consequences on the host.},

Recently, the molecular interactions involved in the immune system have been uncovered. At the same time, the role of the bacterial flora and its interactions with the host immune system have been identified. In this article, we try to reconcile these findings to draw a consistent picture of the host defense system. Specifically, we first argue that the network of molecular interactions involved in immune functions has a bow-tie architecture that entails inherent trade-offs among robustness, fragility, resource limitation, and performance. Second, we discuss the possibility that commensal bacteria and the host immune system constitute an integrated defense system. This symbiotic association has evolved to optimize its robustness against pathogen attacks and nutrient perturbations by harboring a broad range of microorganisms. Owing to the inherent propensity of a host immune system toward hyperactivity, maintenance of bacterial flora homeostasis might be particularly important in the development of preventive strategies against immune disorders such as autoimmune diseases.},

Despite great progress recently, substantial challenges remain, including discriminating biological variation from technical noise. Here we apply the SMART-seq single-cell RNA-seq protocol to study the reference lymphoblastoid cell line GM12878. By using spike-in quantification standards, we estimate the absolute number of RNA molecules per cell for each gene and find significant variation in total mRNA content: between 50,000 and 300,000 transcripts per cell. We directly measure technical stochasticity by a pool/split design and find that there are significant differences in expression between individual cells, over and above technical variation. Specific gene coexpression modules were preferentially expressed in subsets of individual cells, including one enriched for mRNA processing and splicing factors. We assess cell-to-cell variation in alternative splicing and allelic bias and report evidence of significant differences in splice site usage that exceed splice variation in the pool/split comparison. Finally, we show that transcriptomes from small pools of 30-100 cells approach the information content and reproducibility of contemporary RNA-seq from large amounts of input material. Together, our results define an experimental and computational path forward for analyzing gene expression in rare cell types and cell states.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Aspirin is known to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. In a previous study, we quantified the \textit{in vitro} growth kinetics of different CRC tumour cell lines treated with varying doses of aspirin, measuring the rate of cell division and cell death. Here, we use these measured parameters to calculate the chances of successful clonal expansion and to determine the evolutionary potential of the tumour cell lines in the presence and absence of aspirin. The calculations indicate that aspirin increases the probability that a single tumour cell fails to clonally expand. Further, calculations suggest that aspirin increases the evolutionary potential of an expanding tumour cell colony. An aspirin-treated tumour cell population is predicted to result in the accumulation of more mutations (and is thus more virulent and more difficult to treat) than a cell population of the same size that grew without aspirin. This indicates a potential trade-off between delaying the onset of cancer and increasing its evolutionary potential through chemoprevention. Further work needs to investigate to what extent these findings apply to \textit{in vivo} settings, and to what degree they contribute to the epidemiologically documented aspirin-mediated protection.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We exemplify these capabilities by simulation of a 3D single-cell-based model of mouse small intestinal crypts. We analyse the impact of lineage specification, distribution and cellular lifespan on clonal competition and study effects of Notch- and Wnt activation on fixation of mutations within the tissue. Based on these results, we predict that experimentally observed synergistic effects between autonomous Notch- and Wnt signalling in triggering intestinal tumourigenesis originate in the suppression of Wnt-dependent secretory lineage specification by Notch, giving rise to an increased fixation probability of Wnt-activating mutations. Our study demonstrates that 3D computational tissue models can support a mechanistic understanding of long-term tissue dynamics under homeostasis and during transformation.},

In this article, we attempt to re-assess the data, including historical information often omitted in recent studies on the subject. The conclusion we draw is that the evidence supports the concept that active murine small intestinal stem cells in steady state are few in number and are proliferative. There are two evolving, but divergent views on their location (which may be more related to scope of capability and reversibility than to location) several lineage labelling and stem cell self-renewing studies (based on Lgr5 expression) suggest a location intercalated between the Paneth cells (crypt base columnar cells (CBCCs)), or classical cell kinetic, label-retention and radiobiological evidence plus other recent studies, pointing to a location four cell positions luminally from the base of the crypt The latter is supported by recent lineage labelling of Bmi-1-expressing cells and by studies on expression of Wip-1 phosphatase. The situation in the human small intestine remains unclear, but recent mtDNA mutation studies suggest that the stem cells in humans are also located above the Paneth cell zone. There could be a distinct and as yet undiscovered relationship between these observed traits, with stem cell properties both in cells of the crypt base and those at cell position 4.},

However, by eliminating the therapy-sensitive population, this strategy accelerates emergence of resistant clones that proliferate unopposed by competitors-an evolutionary phenomenon termed "competitive release." We present an evolution-guided treatment strategy designed to maintain a stable population of chemosensitive cells that limit proliferation of resistant clones by exploiting the fitness cost of the resistant phenotype. We treated MDA-MB-231/luc triple-negative and MCF7 estrogen receptor-positive (ER(+)) breast cancers growing orthotopically in a mouse mammary fat pad with paclitaxel, using algorithms linked to tumor response monitored by magnetic resonance imaging. We found that initial control required more intensive therapy with regular application of drug to deflect the exponential tumor growth curve onto a plateau. Dose-skipping algorithms during this phase were less successful than variable dosing algorithms. However, once initial tumor control was achieved, it was maintained with progressively smaller drug doses. In 60 to 80\% of animals, continued decline in tumor size permitted intervals as long as several weeks in which no treatment was necessary. Magnetic resonance images and histological analysis of tumors controlled by adaptive therapy demonstrated increased vascular density and less necrosis, suggesting that vascular normalization resulting from enforced stabilization of tumor volume may contribute to ongoing tumor control with lower drug doses. Our study demonstrates that an evolution-based therapeutic strategy using an available chemotherapeutic drug and conventional clinical imaging can prolong the progression-free survival in different preclinical models of breast cancer.},

Besides differences in dosage, differences in biological function of Wnt proteins in various blood cell types also is a major factor to take into account.

Recent work reveals how stem cell (SC) populations meet these requirements by switching between functional states tuned to homoeostasis or regeneration. This plasticity extends to differentiating cells, which are capable of reverting to SCs after injury. The concept of the niche, the micro-environment that sustains and regulates stem cells, is broadening, with a new appreciation of the role of physical factors and hormonal signals.

The cell cycle status of the harvested HSC from mobilized PB (MPB) is of interest because of the impact that cell cycling may have on optimizing the conditions for ex vivo expansion, retrovirus-mediated gene transfer, and the engraftment of transplanted tissues. Therefore, we characterized the cell cycling status of mobilized HSC from mice and humans. The murine HSC, which express the phenotype c-kit+ Thy-1.1lo Lin{\textbackslash}textminus/lo Sca-1+, were purified from PB, bone marrow (BM), and spleen after the mice were treated with the mobilizing regimen of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF ) or a combination of cyclophosphamide (CTX) and G-CSF. Human HSC (CD34+ Thy-1+ Lin{\textbackslash}textminus) and progenitor cells (CD34+ Thy-1{\textbackslash}textminus Lin{\textbackslash}textminus) were isolated from the BM of untreated healthy volunteers and from MPB of healthy volunteers and patients treated with G-CSF or a combination of CTX and GM-CSF. Cell cycle status was determined by quantitating the amount of DNA in the purified cells after staining with the dye Hoechst 33342. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of the progenitor cells from the murine and human samples showed an unexpected finding, ie, virtually none of the cells from the MPB was cycling. The G0/G1 status of HSC from MPB was surprising, because a significant proportion of HSC from BM are actively proliferating and, after mobilization, the HSC in the spleen and BM were also actively cycling.},

	abstract = {Many organisms, from slime molds to jellyfish, alternate between life as free-moving “nomadic” individuals and communal life in a more stationary colony. So what evolutionary reasons lie behind such stark behavioral diversity in a single species? What benefits are obtained by switching from one behavior to another? Tan and Cheong have now developed a mathematical model that suggests an intriguing possibility: under conditions that would cause the extinction of both nomadic individuals and colonies, switching between these life strategies can enable populations to survive and grow – a counter-intuitive phenomenon called Parrondo’s paradox. Parrondo’s paradox says that it is possible to follow two losing strategies in a specific order such that success is ultimately achieved. For example, slot machines are designed to ensure that players lose in the long run. What the paradox says is that two slot machines can be configured in such a way that playing either slot machine will lead to financial disaster, but switching between them will leave the player richer in the long run. Most studies of similar phenomena suggest that switching between two ‘losing’ lifestyle strategies can only improve the chances of survival if the environment keeps changing in unpredictable ways. However, Tan and Cheong’s model shows that this unpredictability is an unnecessary condition – paradoxes also occur when organisms form colonies that predictably destroy their habitat. The basic mechanism for survival is elegant. The organism periodically exploits its habitat as part of a colony, then switches to a nomadic lifestyle to allow the environment to regenerate. Through mathematical analysis and simulations, Tan and Cheong confirm that this strategy is viable as long as two conditions hold: that colonies grow sufficiently quickly when environmental resources are abundant; and that colonists switch to a nomadic lifestyle before allowing the resource levels to dip dangerously low. The results produced by Tan and Cheong’s model help to explain how behavior-switching organisms can survive and thrive, even in harsh conditions. Further work needs to be done to adapt this general model to specific organisms and to investigate the possible evolutionary origins of behavior-switching lifestyles.},

Sometimes tumour cells may adopt genetic strategies that boost their own replication and which also influence other cells in the tumour, whether directly or as a side-effect. Tumour growth as a whole might be enhanced or retarded. We have used mathematical models to study two non-autonomous strategies that tumour cells may use. First, we have considered the production by tumour cells of an angiogenesis growth factor that benefits both the cell from which it originates and neighbouring cells. Second, we have analysed a situation in which tumour cells produce autocrine-only or paracrine-only growth factors to prevent programmed cell death. In the angiogenesis model, stable genetic polymorphisms are likely to occur between cells producing and not producing the growth factor. In the programmed cell death model, cells with autocrine growth factor production can spread throughout the tumour. Production of paracrine-only growth factor is never selected because it is 'altruistic' (that is of no benefit to the cell that makes the growth factor), despite being potentially beneficial to tumour growth as a whole. No polymorphisms can occur in the programmed cell death model. Production of angiogenesis and other growth factors in tumours may be under stable genetic, rather than epigenetic, control, with implications for therapies aimed at such targets. Many of the mutations observed in tumours may have non-autonomous effects.},

Here, we used sensitive in vivo approaches to quantitatively and kinetically assess the MegE potential of hematopoietic stem cells and various Flk2(+) early progenitors and compared it with the MegE potential of downstream committed myeloid and lymphoid progenitors and with their ability to give rise to mature myelomonocytic and lymphoid cells. We demonstrate that Flk2(+) early progenitors retain MegE potential in vivo both at the population and clonal levels. These results indicate that Flk2 expression by early progenitors is not at the expense of full multipotency and support the current model of hematopoietic development with segregation of myeloid and lymphoid lineages from multipotent progenitors.},

A bistable toggle switch constitutes a molecular mechanism that determines cellular commitment and provides stability to transcriptional programs of binary cell fate choices. Experiments support that perturbations of these toggle switches can interconvert these binary cell fate choices, suggesting potential reprogramming strategies. However, more complex types of cellular transitions could involve perturbations of combinations of different types of multistable motifs. Here we introduce a method that generalizes the concept of transcription factor cross-repression to systematically predict sets of genes, whose perturbations induce cellular transitions between any given pair of cell types. Furthermore, to our knowledge, this is the first method that systematically makes these predictions without prior knowledge of potential candidate genes and pathways involved, providing guidance on systems where little is known. Given the increasing interest of cellular reprogramming in medicine and basic research, our method represents a useful computational methodology to assist researchers in the field in designing experimental strategies.},

Except for cases where physical principles provide sufficient guidance, it will also be generally possible to come up with a large number of potential models that are compatible with a given natural system and any finite amount of data generated from experiments on that system. Here we develop a computational framework to systematically evaluate potentially vast sets of candidate differential equation models in light of experimental and prior knowledge about biological systems. This topological sensitivity analysis enables us to evaluate quantitatively the dependence of model inferences and predictions on the assumed model structures. Failure to consider the impact of structural uncertainty introduces biases into the analysis and potentially gives rise to misleading conclusions.},

The example demonstrates how the software provides novel tools that support the inference and validation of mechanistic hypotheses and the inclusion of data constraints in both quantitative and qualitative ways.

	abstract = {A fundamental problem in cancer drug development is that antitumor efficacy in preclinical cancer models does not translate faithfully to patient outcomes. Much of early cancer drug discovery is performed under in vitro conditions in cell-based models that poorly represent actual malignancies. To address this inconsistency, we have developed a technology platform called CIVO, which enables simultaneous assessment of up to eight drugs or drug combinations within a single solid tumor in vivo. The platform is currently designed for use in animal models of cancer and patients with superficial tumors but can be modified for investigation of deeper-seated malignancies. In xenograft lymphoma models, CIVO microinjection of well-characterized anticancer agents (vincristine, doxorubicin, mafosfamide, and prednisolone) induced spatially defined cellular changes around sites of drug exposure, specific to the known mechanisms of action of each drug. The observed localized responses predicted responses to systemically delivered drugs in animals. In pair-matched lymphoma models, CIVO correctly demonstrated tumor resistance to doxorubicin and vincristine and an unexpected enhanced sensitivity to mafosfamide in multidrug-resistant lymphomas compared with chemotherapy-naïve lymphomas. A CIVO-enabled in vivo screen of 97 approved oncology agents revealed a novel mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway inhibitor that exhibits significantly increased tumor-killing activity in the drug-resistant setting compared with chemotherapy-naïve tumors. Finally, feasibility studies to assess the use of CIVO in human and canine patients demonstrated that microinjection of drugs is toxicity-sparing while inducing robust, easily tracked, drug-specific responses in autochthonous tumors, setting the stage for further application of this technology in clinical trials.},

Combining a conditional mouse model that closely resembles the slow evolution and the mosaic AE expression pattern of human t(8;21) CBF AML with global transcriptome sequencing, we find that disease progression was characterized by two principal pathogenic mechanisms. Initially, AE expression modified the lineage potential of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), resulting in the selective expansion of the myeloid compartment at the expense of normal erythro- and lymphopoiesis. This lineage skewing was followed by a second substantial rewiring of transcriptional networks occurring in the trajectory to manifest leukaemia. We also find that both HSC and lineage-restricted granulocyte macrophage progenitors (GMPs) acquired leukaemic stem cell (LSC) potential being capable of initiating and maintaining the disease. Finally, our data demonstrate that long-term expression of AE induces an indolent myeloproliferative disease (MPD)-like myeloid leukaemia phenotype with complete penetrance and that acute inactivation of AE function is a potential novel therapeutic option.},

However, the role of Wnts and their source in adult hematopoiesis is still unclear, and is clinically important as upstream Wnt inhibitors enter clinical trials. We blocked Wnt secretion in hematopoietic lineages by targeting \textit{Porcn}, a membrane-bound \textit{O}-acyltransferase that is indispensable for the activity and secretion of all vertebrate Wnts. Surprisingly, deletion of \textit{Porcn} in \textit{Rosa-CreER}$^{\textrm{\textit{T2}}}$\textit{/Porcn}$^{\textrm{\textit{Del}}}$, \textit{MX1-Cre/Porcn}$^{\textrm{\textit{Del}}}$, and \textit{Vav-Cre/Porcn}$^{\textrm{\textit{Del}}}$ mice had no effects on proliferation, differentiation, or self-renewal of adult hematopoietic stem cells. Targeting Wnt secretion in the bone marrow niche by treatment with a PORCN inhibitor, C59, similarly had no effect on hematopoiesis. These results exclude a role for hematopoietic PORCN-dependent Wnts in adult hematopoiesis. Clinical use of upstream Wnt inhibitors is not likely to be limited by effects on hematopoiesis.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Biofilm communities of \textit{Bacillus subtilis} bacteria have recently been shown to exhibit collective growth-rate oscillations mediated by electrochemical signaling to cope with nutrient starvation. These oscillations emerge once the colony reaches a large enough number of cells. However, it remains unclear whether the amplitude of the oscillations, and thus their effectiveness, builds up over time gradually, or if they can emerge instantly with a non-zero amplitude. Here we address this question by combining microfluidics-based time-lapse microscopy experiments with a minimal theoretical description of the system in the form of a delay-differential equation model. Analytical and numerical methods reveal that oscillations arise through a subcritical Hopf bifurcation, which enables instant high amplitude oscillations. Consequently, the model predicts a bistable regime where an oscillating and a non-oscillating attractor coexist in phase space. We experimentally validate this prediction by showing that oscillations can be triggered by perturbing the media conditions, provided the biofilm size lies within an appropriate range. The model also predicts that the minimum size at which oscillations start decreases with stress, a fact that we also verify experimentally. Taken together, our results show that collective oscillations in cell populations can emerge suddenly with non-zero amplitude via a discontinuous transition.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

MaxEnt originated in the statistical physics of Boltzmann and Gibbs, as a theoretical tool for predicting the equilibrium states of thermal systems. Later, entropy maximization was also applied to matters of information, signal transmission, and image reconstruction. Recently, since the work of Shore and Johnson, MaxEnt has been regarded as a principle that is broader than either physics or information alone. MaxEnt is a procedure that ensures that inferences drawn from stochastic data satisfy basic self-consistency requirements. The different historical justifications for the entropy \$S={\textbackslash}ensuremath-{\textbackslash}ensuremath{\textbackslash}sum\_ip\_i{\textbackslash}mathrmlog p\_i\$ and its corresponding variational principles are reviewed. As an illustration of the broadening purview of maximum entropy principles, maximum caliber, which is path entropy maximization applied to the trajectories of dynamical systems, is also reviewed. Examples are given in which maximum caliber is used to interpret dynamical fluctuations in biology and on the nanoscale, in single-molecule and few-particle systems such as molecular motors, chemical reactions, biological feedback circuits, and diffusion in microfluidics devices.},

The functional roles of multi-signaling pathway crosstalks in EMT are sophisticated and, thus, remain to be explored. In this review, we focused on three major signal transduction pathways that promote or regulate EMT in carcinoma.

We analysed a 12 treatment groups trial on an ovarian cancer xenograft, reproducing current therapeutic options for this cancer including one-, two- and three-drug schemes of cisplatin (DDP), bevacizumab (BEV) and paclitaxel (PTX) with conventional and two levels ("equi" and "high") of dose-dense schedules. All individual tumor growth curves were decoded via separate measurements of cell death and other antiproliferative effects, gaining fresh insight in the differences between treatment options. Individual drug treatments were cytostatic, but only DDP and PTX were also cytotoxic. After treatment, regrowth stabilized with increased propensity to quiescence, particularly with BEV. More cells were killed by PTX dose-dense-equi than with PTX conventional, but with the addition of DDP cytotoxicity was similar and considerably less than expected from that of individual drugs. In the DDP/PTX dose-dense-high scheme both cell death and regrowth impairment were intensified enough to achieve complete remission and addition of BEV increased cell death in all schemes. The results support the option for dose-dense PTX chemotherapy with active single doses, showing the relative additional contribution of BEV, but also indicate negative drug interactions in concomitant DDP/PTX treatments, suggesting that sequential schedules could improve antitumor efficacy.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The map between genotype and phenotype is fundamental to biology. Biological information is stored and passed on in the form of genotypes, and expressed in the form of phenotypes. A growing body of literature has examined a wide range of genotype–phenotype (GP) maps and has established a number of properties that appear to be shared by many GP maps. These properties are ‘structural’ in the sense that they are properties of the distribution of phenotypes across the point-mutation network of genotypes. They include: a redundancy of genotypes, meaning that many genotypes map to the same phenotypes, a highly non-uniform distribution of the number of genotypes per phenotype, a high robustness of phenotypes and the ability to reach a large number of new phenotypes within a small number of mutational steps. A further important property is that the robustness and evolvability of phenotypes are positively correlated. In this review, I give an overview of the study of GP maps with particular emphasis on these structural properties, and discuss a model that attempts to explain why these properties arise, as well as some of the fundamental ways in which the structure of GP maps can affect evolutionary outcomes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We evaluated to what extend prognostic scores as described for adults (e.g., Sokal, Hasford, EUTOS score) resulted in comparable risk group categorizations in a pediatric cohort. Parameters for score calculation were extracted from a data set of 90 patients enrolled into trial CML-PAED-II and treated by a standard dose of imatinib. At month 3 and at month 6, treatment response was analyzed based on the transcript ratio BCR-ABL1/ABL1. By the EUTOS, Hasford, and Sokal scores 81, 59, and 62 \% of the patients were categorized as low risk, respectively; 19, 14, and 16 \% of the patients as high risk, respectively; and by Hasford and Sokal scores 27 and 22 \% of the patients, respectively, as intermediate risk. Twenty-seven out of 72 patients analyzable (38 \%) exhibited a transcript ratio {\textgreater}10 \% at month 3. We show that only the EUTOS score, but not the Sokal and Hasford score, correlates with this early outcome (p = 0.008). Analyzing the EUTOS score separately, we can demonstrate that lowering the cutoff from 87 to 48 points for categorization in low- and high-risk individuals increases the odds ratio from 2.4 (95 \% CI 0.6 to 10.4) to 3.6 (95 \% CI 1.3 to 10.9). Data are provided on the distribution of risk categories and resulting discrepancies when adult scores are applied on children and adolescents with CML at diagnosis. A larger number of patients and longer follow-up are still needed to develop a prognostic score specifically adapted to the pediatric and adolescent age cohorts.},

The data set allowed for an algorithmically driven assembly of related cell types defined by surface antigen expression, providing a superimposable map of cell signaling responses in combination with drug inhibition. Visualized in this manner, the analysis revealed previously unappreciated instances of both precise signaling responses that were bounded within conventionally defined cell subsets and more continuous phosphorylation responses that crossed cell population boundaries in unexpected manners yet tracked closely with cellular phenotype. Collectively, such single-cell analyses provide system-wide views of immune signaling in healthy human hematopoiesis, against which drug action and disease can be compared for mechanistic studies and pharmacologic intervention.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Biological systems have evolved a degree of robustness with respect to perturbations in their environment and this capability is essential for their survival. In applications ranging from therapeutics to conservation, it is important to understand not only the sensitivity of biological systems to changes in their environments, but which features of these systems are necessary to achieve a given outcome. Mathematical models are increasingly employed to understand these mechanisms. Sensitivity analyses of such mathematical models provide insight into the responsiveness of the system when experimental manipulation is difficult. One common approach is to seek the probability distribution of the outputs of the system corresponding to a known distribution of inputs. By contrast, inverse sensitivity analysis determines the probability distribution of model inputs which produces a known distribution of outputs. The computational complexity of the methods used to conduct inverse sensitivity analyses for deterministic systems has limited their application to models with relatively few parameters. Here we describe a novel Markov Chain Monte Carlo method we call "Contour Monte Carlo", which can be used to invert systems with a large number of parameters. We demonstrate the utility of this method by inverting a range of frequently-used deterministic models of biological systems, including the logistic growth equation, the Michaelis-Menten equation, and an SIR model of disease transmission with nine input parameters. We argue that the simplicity of our approach means it is amenable to a large class of problems of practical significance and, more generally, provides a probabilistic framework for understanding the inversion of deterministic models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

To address this, we developed a unique surgical multisampling scheme to collect spatially distinct tumor fragments from 11 GB patients. We present an integrated genomic analysis that uncovers extensive intratumor heterogeneity, with most patients displaying different GB subtypes within the same tumor. Moreover, we reconstructed the phylogeny of the fragments for each patient, identifying copy number alterations in EGFR and CDKN2A/B/p14ARF as early events, and aberrations in PDGFRA and PTEN as later events during cancer progression. We also characterized the clonal organization of each tumor fragment at the single-molecule level, detecting multiple coexisting cell lineages.

	abstract = {We developed deconvolution of single-cell expression distribution (DESCEND), a method to recover cross-cell distribution of the true gene expression level from observed counts in single-cell RNA sequencing, allowing adjustment of known confounding cell-level factors. With the recovered distribution, DESCEND provides reliable estimates of distribution-based measurements, such as the dispersion of true gene expression and the probability that true gene expression is positive. This is important, as with better estimates of these measurements, DESCEND clarifies and improves many downstream analyses including finding differentially expressed genes, identifying cell types, and selecting differentiation markers. Another contribution is that we verified using nine public datasets a simple “Poisson-alpha” noise model for the technical noise of unique molecular identifier-based single-cell RNA-sequencing data, clarifying the current intense debate on this issue. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables the quantification of each gene’s expression distribution across cells, thus allowing the assessment of the dispersion, nonzero fraction, and other aspects of its distribution beyond the mean. These statistical characterizations of the gene expression distribution are critical for understanding expression variation and for selecting marker genes for population heterogeneity. However, scRNA-seq data are noisy, with each cell typically sequenced at low coverage, thus making it difficult to infer properties of the gene expression distribution from raw counts. Based on a reexamination of nine public datasets, we propose a simple technical noise model for scRNA-seq data with unique molecular identifiers (UMI). We develop deconvolution of single-cell expression distribution (DESCEND), a method that deconvolves the true cross-cell gene expression distribution from observed scRNA-seq counts, leading to improved estimates of properties of the distribution such as dispersion and nonzero fraction. DESCEND can adjust for cell-level covariates such as cell size, cell cycle, and batch effects. DESCEND’s noise model and estimation accuracy are further evaluated through comparisons to RNA FISH data, through data splitting and simulations and through its effectiveness in removing known batch effects. We demonstrate how DESCEND can clarify and improve downstream analyses such as finding differentially expressed genes, identifying cell types, and selecting differentiation markers.},

The virus, which we name Entomophthovirus, is a capsid-forming, positive-strand RNA virus in the viral family iflaviridae, whose known members almost exclusively infect insects. We show that the virus RNA is expressed at high levels in fungal cells in vitro and during in vivo infections of Drosophila melanogaster, and that virus particles are present in E. muscae. Two close relatives of the virus had been previously described as insect viruses based on the presence of viral genomes in transcriptomes assembled from RNA extracted from wild dipterans. By analyzing sequencing data from these earlier reports, we show that both dipteran samples were co-infected with E. muscae. We also find the virus in RNA sequencing data from samples of two other species of dipterans, Musca domestica and Delia radicum, known to be infected with E. muscae. These data establish that Entomophthovirus is widely, and seemingly obligately, associated with E. muscae. As other members of the iflaviridae cause behavioral changes in insects, we speculate on the possibility that Entomophthovirus plays a role in E. muscae involved host manipulation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We observe a coupling between interaction strengths and the network's local structure, with the counterintuitive consequence that social networks are robust to the removal of the strong ties but fall apart after a phase transition if the weak ties are removed. We show that this coupling significantly slows the diffusion process, resulting in dynamic trapping of information in communities and find that, when it comes to information diffusion, weak and strong ties are both simultaneously ineffective.},

With this in mind, we have developed improved methodologies based on sequential grinding and enzymatic digestion of murine bone tissue to harvest higher numbers of BM cells and HSC from the endosteal and central marrow regions. This methodology resulted in up to a sixfold greater recovery of primitive hemopoietic cells (lineage(-)Sca(+)Kit(+) [LSK] cells) and HSC as shown by transplant studies. HSC from different anatomical regions of the marrow exhibited important functional differences. Compared with their central marrow counterparts, HSC isolated from the endosteal region (a) had 1.8-fold greater proliferative potential, (b) exhibited almost twofold greater ability to home to the BM following tail vein injection and to lodge in the endosteal region, and (c) demonstrated significantly greater long-term hemopoietic reconstitution potential as shown using limiting dilution competitive transplant assays.},

	abstract = {The ability of cancer cells to break out of tissue compartments and invade locally gives solid tumours a defining deadly characteristic. One of the first steps of invasion is the remodelling of the surrounding tissue or extracellular matrix (ECM) and a major part of this process is the over-expression of proteolytic enzymes, such as the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), by the cancer cells to break down ECM proteins. Degradation of the matrix enables the cancer cells to migrate through the tissue and subsequently to spread to secondary sites in the body, a process known as metastasis. In this paper we undertake an analysis of a mathematical model of cancer cell invasion of tissue, or ECM, which focuses on the role of the urokinase plasminogen activation system. The model consists of a system of five reaction-diffusion-taxis partial differential equations describing the interactions between cancer cells, uPA, uPA inhibitors, plasmin and the host tissue. Cancer cells react chemotactically and haptotactically to the spatio-temporal effects of the uPA system. The results obtained from computational simulations carried out on the model equations produce dynamic heterogeneous spatio-temporal solutions and using linear stability analysis we show that this is caused by a taxis-driven instability of a spatially homogeneous steady-state. Finally we consider the biological implications of the model results, draw parallels with clinical samples and laboratory based models of cancer cell invasion using three-dimensional invasion assay, and go on to discuss future development of the model.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:The invasion of a new species into an established ecosystem can be directly compared to the steps involved in cancer metastasis. Cancer must grow in a primary site, extravasate and survive in the circulation to then intravasate into target organ (invasive species survival in transport). Cancer cells often lay dormant at their metastatic site for a long period of time (lag period for invasive species) before proliferating (invasive spread). Proliferation in the new site has an impact on the target organ microenvironment (ecological impact) and eventually the human host (biosphere impact). RESULTS:Tilman has described mathematical equations for the competition between invasive species in a structured habitat. These equations were adapted to study the invasion of cancer cells into the bone marrow microenvironment as a structured habitat. A large proportion of solid tumor metastases are bone metastases, known to usurp hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) homing pathways to establish footholds in the bone marrow. This required accounting for the fact that this is the natural home of hematopoietic stem cells and that they already occupy this structured space. The adapted Tilman model of invasion dynamics is especially valuable for modeling the lag period or dormancy of cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS:The Tilman equations for modeling the invasion of two species into a defined space have been modified to study the invasion of cancer cells into the bone marrow microenvironment. These modified equations allow a more flexible way to model the space competition between the two cell species. The ability to model initial density, metastatic seeding into the bone marrow and growth once the cells are present, and movement of cells out of the bone marrow niche and apoptosis of cells are all aspects of the adapted equations. These equations are currently being applied to clinical data sets for verification and further refinement of the models.},

Robo4-deficient HSCs displayed poor localization to BM niches and drastically reduced long-term reconstitution capability while retaining multilineage potential. Cxcr4, a critical regulator of HSC location, is upregulated in Robo4(-/-) HSCs to compensate for Robo4 loss. Robo4 deletion led to altered HSC mobilization efficiency, revealing that inhibition of both Cxcr4- and Robo4-mediated niche interactions are necessary for efficient HSC mobilization. Surprisingly, we found that WT HSCs express very low levels of Cxcr4 and respond poorly to Cxcr4 manipulation relative to other hematopoietic cells. We conclude that Robo4 cooperates with Cxcr4 to endow HSCs with competitive access to limited stem cell niches, and we propose Robo4 as a therapeutic target in HSC transplantation therapy.},

The molecular identity of dHSCs and the mechanisms regulating their maintenance or exit from dormancy remain uncertain. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis to show that the transition from dormancy toward cell-cycle entry is a continuous developmental path associated with upregulation of biosynthetic processes rather than a stepwise progression. In addition, low Myc levels and high expression of a retinoic acid program are characteristic for dHSCs. To follow the behavior of dHSCs in situ, a \textit{Gprc5c}-controlled reporter mouse was established. Treatment with all-\textit{trans} retinoic acid antagonizes stress-induced activation of dHSCs by restricting protein translation and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Myc. Mice maintained on a vitamin A-free diet lose HSCs and show a disrupted re-entry into dormancy after exposure to inflammatory stress stimuli.

Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

How often mouse HSCs divide and whether each HSC contributes simultaneously, sequentially, or repetitively to hematopoiesis remains to be determined. We track division of 5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labeled HSC in vivo. We found that, in steady-state mice, bone marrow cells capable of reconstituting lifelong hematopoiesis are found within both fast-cycling (undergoing five or more divisions in 7 wk) and quiescent (undergoing zero divisions in 12-14 wk) lineage marker-negative c-Kit(+) Sca-1(+) populations. The contribution of each population to hematopoiesis can fluctuate with time, and cells with extensive proliferative history are prone to return to quiescence. Furthermore, injection of the bacterial component lipopolysaccharide increased the proliferation and self-renewal capacity of HSCs. These findings suggest a model in which all HSCs undergo dynamic and demand-adapted entry into and exit out of the cell cycle over time. This may facilitate a similar degree of turnover of the entire HSC pool at the end of life.},

	abstract = {RAS mutations arise at high frequency (20-40\%) in both acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (which is considered to be a manifestation of preleukemic disease). In each case, mutations arise predominantly at the N-RAS locus. These observations suggest a fundamental role for this oncogene in leukemogenesis. However, despite its obvious significance, little is known of how this key oncogene may subvert the process of hematopoiesis in human cells. Using CD34+ progenitor cells, we have modeled the preleukemic state by infecting these cells with amphotropic retrovirus expressing mutant N-RAS together with the selectable marker gene lacZ. Expression of the lacZ gene product, beta-galactosidase, allows direct identification and study of N-RAS-expressing cells by incubating infected cultures with a fluorogenic substrate for beta-galactosidase, which gives rise to a fluorescent signal within the infected cells. By using multiparameter flow cytometry, we have studied the ability of CD34+ cells expressing mutant N-RAS to undergo erythroid differentiation induced by erythropoietin. By this means, we have found that erythroid progenitor cells expressing mutant N-RAS exhibit a proliferative defect resulting in an increased cell doubling time and a decrease in the proportion of cells in S + G2M phase of the cell cycle. This is linked to a slowing in the rate of differentiation as determined by comparative cell-surface marker analysis and ultimate failure of the differentiation program at the late-erythroblast stage of development. The dyserythropoiesis was also linked to an increased tendency of the RAS-expressing cells to undergo programmed cell death during their differentiation program. This erythroid lineage dysplasia recapitulates one of the most common features of myelodysplastic syndrome, and for the first time provides a causative link between mutational activation of N-RAS and the pathogenesis of preleukemia.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present a comprehensive computational framework within which the effects of chemical signalling factors on growing epithelial tissues can be studied. The method incorporates a vertex-based cell model, in conjunction with a solver for the governing chemical equations. The vertex model provides a natural mesh for the finite element method (FEM), with node movements determined by force laws. The arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation is adopted to account for domain movement between iterations. The effects of cell proliferation and junctional rearrangements on the mesh are also examined. By implementing refinements of the mesh we show that the finite element (FE) approximation converges towards an accurate numerical solution. The potential utility of the system is demonstrated in the context of Decapentaplegic (Dpp), a morphogen which plays a crucial role in development of the Drosophila imaginal wing disc. Despite the presence of a Dpp gradient, growth is uniform across the wing disc. We make the growth rate of cells dependent on Dpp concentration and show that the number of proliferation events increases in regions of high concentration. This allows hypotheses regarding mechanisms of growth control to be rigorously tested. The method we describe may be adapted to a range of potential application areas, and to other cell-based models with designated node movements, to accurately probe the role of morphogens in epithelial tissues.},

I give a new Monte Carlo numerical integration approach to calculate long-term growth rate, its sensitivities, stable age–stage distributions and reproductive value.

We use a model based on a linked system of differential equations on a lattice to explore how the regional distribution of central nervous system pathology in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome, and fatal familial insomnia relates to each of these factors. The model then is used to make qualitative predictions about the pathology for two possible hypothetical triggers of neuronal loss in prion diseases. Pathological progression in overexpressing mouse models has been shown to depend on the site of initial infection.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Single-cell technologies are offering unprecedented insight into complex biology, revealing the behavior of rare cell populations that are typically masked in bulk population analyses. The application of these methodologies to cell fate reprogramming holds particular promise as the manipulation of cell identity is typically inefficient, generating heterogeneous cell populations. One current limitation of single-cell approaches is that lineage relationships are lost as a result of cell processing, restricting interpretations of the data collected. Here, we present a single-cell resolution lineage-tracing approach based on the combinatorial indexing of cells, CellTagging. Application of this method, in concert with high-throughput single-cell RNA-sequencing, reveals the transcriptional dynamics of direct reprogramming from fibroblasts to induced endoderm progenitors. These analyses demonstrate that while many cells initiate reprogramming, complete silencing of fibroblast identity and transition to a progenitor-like state represents a rare event. Clonal analyses uncover a remarkable degree of heterogeneity arising from individual cells. Overall, very few cells fully reprogram to generate expanded populations with a low degree of clonal diversity. Extended culture of these engineered cells reveals an instability of the reprogrammed state and reversion to a fibroblast-like phenotype. Together, these results demonstrate the utility of our lineage-tracing approach to reveal dynamics of lineage reprogramming, and will be of broad utility in many cell biological applications.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

One of the key issues is distinguishing between the terms control and regulation and how these concepts are applied to regulated enzymes such as phosphofructokinase.

One important objective in scRNA-seq analysis is to cluster cells where each cluster consists of cells belonging to the same cell type based on gene expression patterns.ResultsWe introduce a novel spectral clustering framework that imposes sparse structures on a target matrix. Specifically, we utilize multiple doubly stochastic similarity matrices to learn a similarity matrix, motivated by the observation that each similarity matrix can be a different informative representation of the data. We impose a sparse structure on the target matrix followed by shrinking pairwise differences of the rows in the target matrix, motivated by the fact that the target matrix should have these structures in the ideal case. We solve the proposed non-convex problem iteratively using the ADMM algorithm and show the convergence of the algorithm. We evaluate the performance of the proposed clustering method on various simulated as well as real scRNA-seq data, and show that it can identify clusters accurately and robustly.AvailabilityThe algorithm is implemented in MATLAB.

When an HSPC arrives in the perivascular niche, a group of endothelial cells remodel to form a surrounding pocket. This structure appears conserved in mouse fetal liver. Correlative light and electron microscopy revealed that endothelial cells surround a single HSPC attached to a single mesenchymal stromal cell. Live imaging showed that mesenchymal stromal cells anchor HSPCs and orient their divisions. A chemical genetic screen found that the compound lycorine promotes HSPC-niche interactions during development and ultimately expands the stem cell pool into adulthood.

In this article, we construct a partial differential equation model of a single colonic crypt that describes the spatial distribution of Wnt pathway proteins along the crypt axis. The novelty of our continuum model is that it is based upon assumptions that can be directly related to processes at the cellular and subcellular scales. We use the model to predict how the distributions of Wnt pathway proteins are affected by mutations. The model is then extended to investigate how mutant cell populations can invade neighboring crypts. The model simulations suggest that cell crowding caused by increased proliferation and decreased cell loss may be sufficient for a mutant cell population to colonize a neighboring healthy crypt.},

Moreover, little is known about how cell-fate determinants are regulated in functionally important subnetworks in large gene-regulatory networks (i.e., GRN motifs). Here we propose a model of stem cell differentiation in which cell-fate determinants work synergistically to determine different cellular identities, and reside in a class of GRN motifs known as feedback loops. Based on this model, we develop a computational method that can systematically predict cell-fate determinants and their GRN motifs. The method was able to recapitulate experimentally validated cell-fate determinants, and validation of two predicted cell-fate determinants confirmed that overexpression of ESR1 and RUNX2 in mouse neural stem cells induces neuronal and astrocyte differentiation, respectively. Thus, the presented GRN-based model of stem cell differentiation and computational method can guide differentiation experiments in stem cell research and regenerative medicine.},

	abstract = {The importance of proportioning kidney size to body volume was established by clinical studies which demonstrated that in-born defecits of nephron number predispose the kidney to disease. As the kidney develops, the expanding ureteric bud or renal collecting system induces surrounding metanephric mesenchyme to proliferate and differentiate into nephrons. Thus, it is likely that nephron number is related to ureteric bud growth. The expression patterns of mRNAs encoding Fibroblast Growth Factor-7 (FGF-7) and its high affinity receptor suggested that FGF-7 signaling may play a role in regulating ureteric bud growth. To test this hypothesis we examined kidneys from FGF-7-null and wild-type mice. Results of these studies demonstrate that the developing ureteric bud and mature collecting system of FGF-7-null kidneys is markedly smaller than wild type. Furthermore, morphometric analyses indicate that mature FGF-7-null kidneys have 30+/-6\% fewer nephrons than wild-type kidneys. In vitro experiments demonstrate that elevated levels of FGF-7 augment ureteric bud growth and increase the number of nephrons that form in rodent metanephric kidney organ cultures. Collectively, these results demonstrate that FGF-7 levels modulate the extent of ureteric bud growth during development and the number of nephrons that eventually form in the kidney.},

	abstract = {Author Summary In many developing systems, chemical gradients control the formation of segmental domains of gene expression, specifying distinct domains that go on to form different tissues and structures, in a concentration-dependent manner. These gradients are noisy however, raising the question of how sharply delineated boundaries between distinct segments form. It is crucial that developing systems be able to cope with stochasticity and generate well-defined boundaries between different segmented domains. Previous work suggests that cell sorting and cellular plasticity help sharpen boundaries between segments. However, it remains unclear how effective each of these mechanisms is and what their role in sharpening may be. Motivated by recent experimental observations, we construct a hybrid stochastic model to investigate these questions. We find that neither mechanism is sufficient on its own to sharpen boundaries between different segments. Rather, results indicate each has its own strengths and weaknesses, and that they work together synergistically to promote the development of precise, well defined segment boundaries. Formation of segmented rhombomeres in the zebrafish hindbrain, which later form different components of the central nervous system, is a motivating case for this study.},

The complex three-dimensional shapes derived by this process reflect equally complex genetic interactions between branching epithelia and their surrounding mesenchyme. Despite the importance of this process to normal adult organ function, analysis of branching has been stymied by the absence of a bespoke method to quantify accurately the complex spatial datasets that describe it. As a consequence, although many developmentally important genes are proposed to influence branching morphogenesis, we have no way of objectively assessing their individual contributions to this process. We report the development of a method for accurately quantifying many aspects of branching morphogenesis and we demonstrate its application to the study of organ development. As proof of principle we have employed this approach to analyse the developing mouse lung and kidney, describing the spatial characteristics of the branching ureteric bud and pulmonary epithelia. To demonstrate further its capacity to profile unrecognised genetic contributions to organ development, we examine Tgfb2 mutant kidneys, identifying elements of both developmental delay and specific spatial dysmorphology caused by haplo-insufficiency for this gene. This technical advance provides a crucial resource that will enable rigorous characterisation of the genetic and environmental factors that regulate this essential and evolutionarily conserved developmental mechanism.},

	abstract = {Many RNAs, proteins, and organelles are present in such low numbers per cell that random segregation of individual copies causes large "partitioning errors" at cell division. Even symmetrically dividing cells can then by chance produce daughters with very different composition. The size of the errors depends on the segregation mechanism: Control systems can reduce low-abundance errors, but the segregation process can also be subject to upstream sources of randomness or spatial heterogeneities that create large errors despite high abundances. Here we mathematically demonstrate how partitioning errors arise for different types of segregation mechanisms and how errors can be greatly increased by upstream heterogeneity but remarkably hard to avoid through controlled partitioning. We also show that seemingly straightforward experiments cannot be straightforwardly interpreted because very different mechanisms produce identical fits and present an approach to deal with this problem by adding binomial counting noise and testing for convexity or concavity in the partitioning error as a function of the binomial thinning parameter. The results lay a conceptual groundwork for more effective studies of heterogeneity among growing and dividing cells, whether in microbes or in differentiating tissues.},

To understand regulation of fate decisions, therefore, would require a means of understanding carefully choreographed combinatorial interactions. Here we used microenvironment protein microarrays to functionally identify combinations of cell-extrinsic mammary gland proteins and ECM molecules that imposed specific cell fates on bipotent human mammary progenitor cells. Micropatterned cell culture surfaces were fabricated to distinguish between the instructive effects of cell-cell versus cell-ECM interactions, as well as constellations of signaling molecules; and these were used in conjunction with physiologically relevant 3 dimensional human breast cultures. Both immortalized and primary human breast progenitors were analyzed. We report on the functional ability of those proteins of the mammary gland that maintain quiescence, maintain the progenitor state, and guide progenitor differentiation towards myoepithelial and luminal lineages.},

Our partitioning algorithm yields geographically cohesive regions that correspond remarkably well with administrative regions, while unveiling unexpected spatial structures that had previously only been hypothesized in the literature. We also quantify the effects of partitioning, showing for instance that the effects of a possible secession of Wales from Great Britain would be twice as disruptive for the human network than that of Scotland.},

However, existing methods for optimal experiment design (OED) rely on assumptions that are inappropriate when data are scarce considering model complexity. RESULTS: We have developed a novel method to perform OED for models that cope with large parameter uncertainty. We employ a Bayesian approach involving importance sampling of the posterior predictive distribution to predict the efficacy of a new measurement at reducing the uncertainty of a selected prediction. We demonstrate the method by applying it to a case where we show that specific combinations of experiments result in more precise predictions.

We have used time-lapse mosaic analysis to investigate normal cell fates within the growing UB and the developmental potential of cells lacking Ret. We found that normal tip cells are bipotential, contributing to both tips and trunks. Cells lacking Ret are specifically excluded from the tips, although they contribute to the trunks, revealing that the tips form and expand by GDNF-driven cell proliferation.

	abstract = {Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signaling is involved in different stages of mammalian development and implicated in various cancers (e.g. colorectal cancer). Recent experimental and computational studies have revealed characteristics of the pathway, however a cell-specific spatial perspective is lacking. In this study, a novel 3D confocal quantitation protocol is developed to acquire spatial (two cellular compartments: nucleus and cytosol-membrane) and temporal quantitative data on target protein (e.g. $\beta$-catenin) concentrations in Human Epithelial Kidney cells (HEK293T) during perturbation (with either cycloheximide or Wnt3A). Computational models of the Wnt pathway are constructed and interrogated based on this data. RESULTS:A single compartment Wnt pathway model is compared with a simple $\beta$-catenin two compartment model to investigate Wnt3A signaling in HEK293T cells. When protein synthesis is inhibited, $\beta$-catenin decreases at the same rate in both cellular compartments, suggesting diffusional transport is fast compared to $\beta$-catenin degradation in the cytosol. With Wnt3A stimulation, the total amount of $\beta$-catenin rises throughout the cell, however the increase is initially ({\textbackslash}textasciitildefirst hour) faster in the nuclear compartment. While both models were able to reproduce the whole cell changes in $\beta$-catenin, only the compartment model reproduced the Wnt3A induced changes in $\beta$-catenin distribution and it was also the best fit for the data obtained when active transport was included alongside passive diffusion transport. CONCLUSIONS:This integrated 3D quantitation imaging protocol and computational modeling approach allowed cell-specific compartment models of the signaling pathways to be constructed and analyzed. The Wnt models constructed in this study are the first for HEK293T and have suggested potential roles of inter-compartment transport to the dynamics of signaling.},

While methods for assaying spatial expression profiles are increasingly accessible, there is a lack of computational approaches that allow for studying the relevance of the spatial organization of tissues on cell-cell heterogeneity. Here, we present spatial variance component analysis (SVCA), a computational framework for the analysis of spatial molecular data. SVCA estimates signatures of spatial variance components, thereby quantifying the effect of cell-cell interactions, as well as environmental and intrinsic cell features on the expression levels of individual molecules. In application to a breast cancer Imaging Mass Cytometry dataset, our model yields robust spatial variance signatures, identifying cell-cell interactions as a major driver of expression heterogeneity. We also apply SVCA to high-dimensional imaging-derived RNA data, where we identify molecular pathways that are linked to cell-cell interactions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The therapeutic control of a solid tumour depends critically on the responses of the individual cells that constitute the entire tumour mass. A particular cell's spatial location within the tumour and intracellular interactions, including the evolution of the cell-cycle within each cell, has an impact on their decision to grow and divide. They are also influenced by external signals from other cells as well as oxygen and nutrient concentrations. Hence, it is important to take these into account when modelling tumour growth and the response to various treatment regimes ('cell-kill therapies'), including chemotherapy. In order to address this multiscale nature of solid tumour growth and its response to treatment, we propose a hybrid, individual-based approach that analyses spatio-temporal dynamics at the level of cells, linking individual cell behaviour with the macroscopic behaviour of cell organisation and the microenvironment. The individual tumour cells are modelled by using a cellular automaton (CA) approach, where each cell has its own internal cell-cycle, modelled using a system of ODEs. The internal cell-cycle dynamics determine the growth strategy in the CA model, making it more predictive and biologically relevant. It also helps to classify the cells according to their cell-cycle states and to analyse the effect of various cell-cycle dependent cytotoxic drugs. Moreover, we have incorporated the evolution of oxygen dynamics within this hybrid model in order to study the effects of the microenvironment in cell-cycle regulation and tumour treatments. An important factor from the treatment point of view is that the low concentration of oxygen can result in a hypoxia-induced quiescence (G0/G1 arrest) of the cancer cells, making them resistant to key cytotoxic drugs. Using this multiscale model, we investigate the impact of oxygen heterogeneity on the spatio-temporal patterning of the cell distribution and their cell-cycle status. We demonstrate that oxygen transport limitations result in significant heterogeneity in HIF-1 α signalling and cell-cycle status, and when these are combined with drug transport limitations, the efficacy of the therapy is significantly impaired.},

We found that these elements displayed fractional Langevin motion (fLm) due to the viscoelastic hindrance from the surrounding network of proteins and chromatin fibers. Using fractional Langevin dynamics modeling, we found that, with high probability, DHJH elements reach a VH element within minutes. Spatial confinement emerged as the dominant parameter that determined the frequency of such encounters. We propose that the viscoelastic nature of the nuclear environment causes coding elements and regulatory elements to bounce back and forth in a spring-like fashion until specific genomic interactions are established and that spatial confinement of topological domains largely controls first-passage times for genomic interactions.},

Moreover, transcriptional changes in HSCs during aging are inversely related to those upon HSC differentiation, such that old short-term (ST) HSCs resemble young long-term (LT-HSCs), suggesting that they exist in a less differentiated state.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Carcinogenesis is an evolutionary process whereby cells accumulate multiple mutations. Besides the ‘driver mutations’ that cause the disease, cells also accumulate a number of other mutations with seemingly no direct role in this evolutionary process. They are called passenger mutations. While it has been argued that passenger mutations render tumours more fragile due to reduced fitness, the role of passenger mutations remains understudied. Using evolutionary computational models, we demonstrate that in the context of tumour suppressor gene inactivation (and hence fitness valley crossing), the presence of passenger mutations can accelerate the rate of evolution by reducing overall population fitness and increasing the relative fitness of intermediate mutants in the fitness valley crossing pathway. Hence, the baseline rate of tumour suppressor gene inactivation might be faster than previously thought. Conceptually, parallels are found in the field of turbulence and pattern formation, where instabilities can be driven by perturbations that are damped (disadvantageous), but provide a richer set of pathways such that a system can achieve some desired goal more readily. This highlights, through a number of novel parallels, the relevance of physical sciences in oncology.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Author Summary The effectiveness of antibiotics on many pathogenic bacteria is compromised by multidrug tolerance. This is caused by a small sub-population of bacteria that happen to be in a dormant, non-dividing state when antibiotics are applied and thus are protected from being killed. These bacteria are called persisters. Unraveling the basic mechanism underlying this phenomenon is a necessary first step to overcome persistent and recurring infections. Experiments have shown a connection between persister formation and the battle between a toxin and its antitoxin inside an E. coli cell. Toxin inhibits the cell growth but is neutralized by the antitoxin by forming a complex. The proteins also regulate their own production through this complex, thereby forming a feedback system that controls the growth of the bacterium. In this work we provide mathematical modeling of the feedback module and explore its abilities. We find that the auto-regulation with reduced growth associated with free toxins allows the cell to be bistable between two states: an antitoxin-dominated, normal growing one, or a dormant one caused by the activity of the toxin. The latter can be the simplest description of persister state. The toxin-antitoxin system presents a powerful example of mixed feedback design, which can support epigenetics.},

Hair follicle stem cells have emerged as a prime model to study stem cell activation. Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signaling controls multiple aspects of skin epithelial regeneration, with its excessive activity promoting the hyperactivation of hair follicle stem/progenitor cells and tumorigenesis. The contribution of chromatin factors in regulating Wnt/$\beta$-catenin pathway function in these processes is unknown. Here, we show that chromatin effector Pygopus homolog 2 (Pygo2) produced by the epithelial cells facilitates depilation-induced hair regeneration, as well as $\beta$-catenin-induced activation of hair follicle stem/early progenitor cells and trichofolliculoma-like skin hyperplasia. Pygo2 maximizes the expression of Wnt/$\beta$-catenin targets, but is dispensable for $\beta$-catenin-mediated expansion of LIM/homeobox protein Lhx2(+) cells, in the stem/early progenitor cell compartment of the hair follicle. Moreover, $\beta$-catenin and Pygo2 converge to induce the accumulation and acetylation of tumor suppressor protein p53 upon the cell cycle entry of hair follicle early progenitor cells and in cultured keratinocytes. These findings identify Pygo2 as an important regulator of Wnt/$\beta$-catenin function in skin epithelia and p53 activation as a prominent downstream event of $\beta$-catenin/Pygo2 action in stem cell activation.},

In microbes, for example, we now know that gene expression across the whole genome typically changes with growth rate. The mechanisms driving such global regulation, however, are not well understood. Here we consider three trade-offs that, because of limitations in levels of cellular energy, free ribosomes, and proteins, are faced by all living cells and we construct a mechanistic model that comprises these trade-offs. Our model couples gene expression with growth rate and growth rate with a growing population of cells. We show that the model recovers Monod's law for the growth of microbes and two other empirical relationships connecting growth rate to the mass fraction of ribosomes. Further, we can explain growth-related effects in dosage compensation by paralogs and predict host-circuit interactions in synthetic biology. Simulating competitions between strains, we find that the regulation of metabolic pathways may have evolved not to match expression of enzymes to levels of extracellular substrates in changing environments but rather to balance a trade-off between exploiting one type of nutrient over another. Although coarse-grained, the trade-offs that the model embodies are fundamental, and, as such, our modeling framework has potentially wide application, including in both biotechnology and medicine.},

	abstract = {Wnt signaling plays an important role in both oncogenesis and development. Activation of the Wnt pathway results in stabilization of the transcriptional coactivator beta-catenin. Recent studies have demonstrated that axin, which coordinates beta-catenin degradation, is itself degraded. Although the key molecules required for transducing a Wnt signal have been identified, a quantitative understanding of this pathway has been lacking. We have developed a mathematical model for the canonical Wnt pathway that describes the interactions among the core components: Wnt, Frizzled, Dishevelled, GSK3beta, APC, axin, beta-catenin, and TCF. Using a system of differential equations, the model incorporates the kinetics of protein-protein interactions, protein synthesis/degradation, and phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. We initially defined a reference state of kinetic, thermodynamic, and flux data from experiments using Xenopus extracts. Predictions based on the analysis of the reference state were used iteratively to develop a more refined model from which we analyzed the effects of prolonged and transient Wnt stimulation on beta-catenin and axin turnover. We predict several unusual features of the Wnt pathway, some of which we tested experimentally. An insight from our model, which we confirmed experimentally, is that the two scaffold proteins axin and APC promote the formation of degradation complexes in very different ways. We can also explain the importance of axin degradation in amplifying and sharpening the Wnt signal, and we show that the dependence of axin degradation on APC is an essential part of an unappreciated regulatory loop that prevents the accumulation of beta-catenin at decreased APC concentrations. By applying control analysis to our mathematical model, we demonstrate the modular design, sensitivity, and robustness of the Wnt pathway and derive an explicit expression for tumor suppression and oncogenicity.},

	abstract = {Apoptosis is a highly regulated cell death mechanism involved in many physiological processes. A key component of extrinsically activated apoptosis is the death receptor Fas which, on binding to its cognate ligand FasL, oligomerize to form the death-inducing signaling complex. Motivated by recent experimental data, we propose a mathematical model of death ligand-receptor dynamics where FasL acts as a clustering agent for Fas, which form locally stable signaling platforms through proximity-induced receptor interactions. Significantly, the model exhibits hysteresis, providing an upstream mechanism for bistability and robustness. At low receptor concentrations, the bistability is contingent on the trimerism of FasL. Moreover, irreversible bistability, representing a committed cell death decision, emerges at high concentrations which may be achieved through receptor pre-association or localization onto membrane lipid rafts. Thus, our model provides a novel theory for these observed biological phenomena within the unified context of bistability. Importantly, as Fas interactions initiate the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, our model also suggests a mechanism by which cells may function as bistable life/death switches independently of any such dynamics in their downstream components. Our results highlight the role of death receptors in deciding cell fate and add to the signal processing capabilities attributed to receptor clustering.},

	abstract = {Persistence of leukemic stem cells (LSC) after chemotherapy is thought to be responsible for relapse and prevents the curative treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. LSC and normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) share many characteristics and co-exist in the bone marrow of AML patients. For the development of successful LSC-targeted therapy, enabling eradication of LSC while sparing HSC, the identification of differences between LSC and HSC residing within the AML bone marrow is crucial. For identification of these LSC targets, as well as for AML LSC characterization, discrimination between LSC and HSC within the AML bone marrow is imperative. Here we show that normal CD34+CD38– HSC present in AML bone marrow, identified by their lack of aberrant immunophenotypic and molecular marker expression and low scatter properties, are a distinct sub-population of cells with high ALDH activity (ALDH bright ). The ALDH bright compartment contains, besides normal HSC, more differentiated, normal CD34+CD38+ progenitors. Furthermore, we show that in CD34-negative AML, containing solely normal CD34+ cells, LSC are CD34– and ALDH low . In CD34-positive AML, LSC are also ALDH low but can be either CD34+ or CD34–. In conclusion, although malignant AML blasts have varying ALDH activity, a common feature of all AML cases is that LSC have lower ALDH activity than the CD34+CD38– HSC that co-exist with these LSC in the AML bone marrow. Our findings form the basis for combined functionally and immunophenotypically based identification and purification of LSC and HSC within the AML bone marrow, aiming at development of highly specific anti-LSC therapy.},

Although damage to the CNS clearly promotes these two processes, the interplay between these complex events and how it affects a response remains elusive. Here, we use spatial stochastic modeling to show that tradeoffs arise between production and recruitment during regeneration. Proper spatial control of cell cycle timing can mitigate these tradeoffs, maximizing recruitment, improving infiltration into the lesion, and reducing wasteful production outside of it. Feedback regulation of cell lineage dynamics alone however leads to spatial defects in cell recruitment, suggesting a novel, to our knowledge, hypothesis for the aggregation of cells to the periphery of a lesion in multiple sclerosis. Interestingly, stronger chemotaxis does not correct this aggregation and instead, substantial random cell motions near the site of the lesion are required to improve CNS regeneration.},

	abstract = {A major effort in systems biology is the development of mathematical models that describe complex biological systems at multiple scales and levels of abstraction. Determining the topology-the set of interactions-of a biological system from observations of the system's behavior is an important and difficult problem. Here we present and demonstrate new methodology for efficiently computing the probability distribution over a set of topologies based on consistency with existing measurements. Key features of the new approach include derivation in a Bayesian framework, incorporation of prior probability distributions of topologies and parameters, and use of an analytically integrable linearization based on the Fisher information matrix that is responsible for large gains in efficiency. The new method was demonstrated on a collection of four biological topologies representing a kinase and phosphatase that operate in opposition to each other with either processive or distributive kinetics, giving 8-12 parameters for each topology. The linearization produced an approximate result very rapidly (CPU minutes) that was highly accurate on its own, as compared to a Monte Carlo method guaranteed to converge to the correct answer but at greater cost (CPU weeks). The Monte Carlo method developed and applied here used the linearization method as a starting point and importance sampling to approach the Bayesian answer in acceptable time. Other inexpensive methods to estimate probabilities produced poor approximations for this system, with likelihood estimation showing its well-known bias toward topologies with more parameters and the Akaike and Schwarz Information Criteria showing a strong bias toward topologies with fewer parameters. These results suggest that this linear approximation may be an effective compromise, providing an answer whose accuracy is near the true Bayesian answer, but at a cost near the common heuristics.},

An optimal experiment allows the inferred models or parameters to be chosen with the highest expected degree of confidence. If the true system is faithfully reproduced by one of the models, the merit of this approach is clear - we simply wish to identify it and the true parameters with the most certainty. However, in the more realistic situation where all models are incorrect or incomplete, the interpretation of model selection outcomes and the role of experimental design needs to be examined more carefully. Using a novel experimental design and model selection framework for stochastic state-space models, we perform high-throughput in-silico analyses on families of gene regulatory cascade models, to show that the selected model can depend on the experiment performed. We observe that experimental design thus makes confidence a criterion for model choice, but that this does not necessarily correlate with a model's predictive power or correctness. Finally, in the special case of linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) models, we explore how wrong a model has to be before it influences the conclusions of a model selection analysis.},

	abstract = {{\textless}h3{\textgreater}INTRODUCTION{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Fate decisions play a central role in the operation of the vertebrate immune system. The establishment of efficient acquired immune responses depends on the differentiation of naïve T cells into various effector and memory cell types upon recognition of a cognate antigen, and on the appropriate balance between these populations. A number of studies have shown that the balance between effector and central memory T cells is shifted in favor of the latter when more T cells participate in the response. This observation has the hallmarks of quorum sensing, the ability of cells to respond to their population density. However, the mechanisms driving this behavior in T cells remain elusive.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}RATIONALE{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}We observed increased differentiation of progenitor central memory T cells (pTCMs) at high cell densities both in vivo and in vitro. However, activated T cells rapidly form dense dynamic clusters, precluding the distinction between the effects of local interactions within cell clusters from global, long-range interactions through soluble factors. To overcome these difficulties, we used live-cell imaging to track the proliferation and differentiation of cells cultured in microwell arrays. This microculture system provides precise control and monitoring of the number of interacting T cells and their state after T cell activation. Continuously tracking differentiation and proliferation enabled us to investigate the mechanisms of cellular collectivity and its influence on memory differentiation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}RESULTS{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}We first validated that the pTCM cells formed early in our cultures show the markings of established central memory T cells using RNA sequencing and in vivo experiments. Then, with our microwell system, we showed that the rate of differentiation of pTCM cells is determined by the number of cells within individual microwells and sharply increases above a threshold number of locally interacting cells. Further analysis showed that cells follow a universal differentiation trajectory, whereby their differentiation rate is continuously modulated by the instantaneous number of interacting cells, rather than simply by the number of cells present initially within each microwell, or by the number of cell divisions. A combination of experimental manipulation and computational simulations showed that the observed collectivity involved increased sensitivity of clustered T cells to the cytokines interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-6, orthogonal to their effect on cell proliferation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}CONCLUSION{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}By systematically analyzing the role of intercellular interactions in a synthetic microenvironment, we showed that local T cell density could modulate the balance between central memory and effector cells independent of further potential influence by antigen-presenting cells or T cell receptor signaling strength. This cellular collectivity is a continuous process and is not determined by the number of cell divisions, but rather by the number of locally interacting cells at any given time. Local collectivity can influence the diversity and magnitude of immune memory, by modulating interactions between T cell clones during their priming in response to antigens. Understanding the rules of T cell social behavior will be important to learn how to manipulate the immune system for therapeutic or prophylactic goals.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The haematopoietic lineages with leukaemia lineages are considered in this paper. In particular, we mainly consider that haematopoietic lineages are tightly controlled by negative feedback inhibition of end-product. Actually, leukemia has been found 100 years ago. Up to now, the exact mechanism is still unknown, and many factors are thought to be associated with the pathogenesis of leukemia. Nevertheless, it is very necessary to continue the profound study of the pathogenesis of leukemia. Here, we propose a new mathematical model which include some negative feedback inhibition from the terminally differentiated cells of haematopoietic lineages to the haematopoietic stem cells and haematopoietic progenitor cells in order to describe the regulatory mechanisms mentioned above by a set of ordinary differential equations. Afterwards, we carried out detailed dynamical bifurcation analysis of the model, and obtained some meaningful results. In this work, we mainly perform the analysis of the mathematic model by bifurcation theory and numerical simulations. We have not only incorporated some new negative feedback mechanisms to the existing model, but also constructed our own model by using the modeling method of stem cell theory with probability method. Through a series of qualitative analysis and numerical simulations, we obtain that the weak negative feedback for differentiation probability is conducive to the cure of leukemia. However, with the strengthening of negative feedback, leukemia will be more difficult to be cured, and even induce death. In contrast, strong negative feedback for differentiation rate of progenitor cells can promote healthy haematopoiesis and suppress leukaemia. These results demonstrate that healthy progenitor cells are bestowed a competitive advantage over leukaemia stem cells. Weak g1, g2, and h1 enable the system stays in the healthy state. However, strong h2 can promote healthy haematopoiesis and suppress leukaemia.},

Here, we study abundances of business categories across US metropolitan statistical areas, and provide a framework for measuring the intrinsic diversity of economic activities that transcends scales of the classification scheme. A universal structure common to all cities is revealed, manifesting self-similarity in internal economic structure as well as aggregated metrics (GDP, patents, crime). We present a simple mathematical derivation of the universality, and provide a model, together with its economic implications of open-ended diversity created by urbanization, for understanding the observed empirical distribution. Given the universal distribution, scaling analyses for individual business categories enable us to determine their relative abundances as a function of city size. These results shed light on the processes of economic differentiation with scale, suggesting a general structure for the growth of national economies as integrated urban systems.},

By comparing the phase portraits of the system without therapy compared to continuous therapy above a certain threshold, we show that chemotherapeutic resistance develops if there are pre-exisiting resistance cells in the population. We examine the basin boundaries of attraction associated with the chemo-sensitive population and the chemo-resistant population for increasing values of chemo-concentrations and show their spiral intertwined structure. We also examine the fitness landscapes both with and without continuous therapy and show that with therapy, the average fitness as well as the fitness functions of each of the subpopulations initially increases, but eventually decreases monotonically as the resistant subpopulation saturates the tumor.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Cancer stem cells are thus likely to be responsible for maintaining or spreading a cancer, and may be the most relevant targets for cancer therapy. The CD133 glycoprotein was recently described as a reliable cancer stem-like cell marker in colon carcinoma. CD133+ cells are both necessary and sufficient to initiate tumour growth in animal models. The CD133+ cell population and spheroid cultures contain cells expressing the stem cell marker Musashi-1 which is involved in maintenance of stem cell fate in several tissues and importantly, this expression is maintained in stem-like cells derived from xenografted tumors. Here we discuss the potential use of the CD133 antigen in concert with Musashi-1 as markers to identify the colon cancer stem cell population. Since the upregulation of IL-4 cytokine was recently demonstrated to constitute an important mechanism that protects the tumorigenic CD133+ cells from apoptosis, the potential benefits of standard chemotherapeutic treatments in combination with IL-4 inhibitors in the context of human colon carcinoma, are also discussed.},

Building on previous work illuminating commonalities between ecological and human systems, we compare the activity patterns of individual financial traders with the simultaneous activity of other traders–an individual and spontaneous characteristic we call synchronous trading. Additionally, we examine the association of synchronous trading with individual performance and communication patterns. Analyzing empirical data on day traders' second-to-second trading and instant messaging, we find that the higher the traders' synchronous trading is, the less likely they are to lose money at the end of the day. We also find that the daily instant messaging patterns of traders are closely associated with their level of synchronous trading. This result suggests that synchronicity and vanguard technology may help traders cope with risky decisions in complex systems and may furnish unique prospects for achieving collective and individual goals.},

	abstract = {The production and degradation of RNA transcripts is inherently subject to biological noise that arises from small gene copy numbers in individual cells. As a result, cellular RNA levels can exhibit large fluctuations over time and from one cell to the next. This article presents a range of precise single-molecule experimental techniques, based upon RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization, which can be used to measure the fluctuations of RNA at the single-cell level. A class of models for gene activation and deactivation is postulated in order to capture complex stochastic effects of chromatin modifications or transcription factor interactions. A computational tool, known as the finite state projection approach, is introduced to accurately and efficiently analyze these models in order to predict how probability distributions of RNA change over time in response to changing environmental conditions. These single-molecule experiments, discrete stochastic models, and computational analyses are systematically integrated to identify models of gene regulation dynamics. To illustrate the power and generality of our integrated experimental and computational approach, we explore cases that include different models for three different RNA types (sRNA, mRNA and nascent RNA), three different experimental techniques and three different biological species (bacteria, yeast and human cells).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Human T lymphotropic virus Type 1 (HTLV-1) causes a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system known as HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM) which resembles chronic spinal forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). The pathogenesis of HAM remains uncertain. To aid in the differential diagnosis of HAM and to identify pathogenetic mechanisms, we analysed the plasma proteome in asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers (ACs), patients with HAM, uninfected controls, and patients with MS. We used surface-enhanced laser desorption-ionization (SELDI) mass spectrometry to analyse the plasma proteome in 68 HTLV-1-infected individuals (in two non-overlapping sets, each comprising 17 patients with HAM and 17 ACs), 16 uninfected controls, and 11 patients with secondary progressive MS. Candidate biomarkers were identified by tandem Q-TOF mass spectrometry. RESULTS:The concentrations of three plasma proteins–high [$\beta$2-microglobulin], high [Calgranulin B], and low [apolipoprotein A2]–were specifically associated with HAM, independently of proviral load. The plasma [$\beta$2-microglobulin] was positively correlated with disease severity. CONCLUSIONS:The results indicate that monocytes are activated by contact with activated endothelium in HAM. Using $\beta$2-microglobulin and Calgranulin B alone we derive a diagnostic algorithm that correctly classified the disease status (presence or absence of HAM) in 81\% of HTLV-1-infected subjects in the cohort.},

	abstract = {In zebrafish, the segmental series of pharyngeal arches is formed predominantly by two migratory cell types, neural crest and paraxial mesoderm, which arise in the early embryo. Neural crest cells migrate ventrally out of the neuroepithelium and into the arches to form cartilage, neurons, glia and pigment cells. Surrounding mesoderm generates muscles and endothelia. We labeled individual pharyngeal precursor cells with fluorescent dyes and found that their clonal progeny were confined to single segments and generated single cell types. When a neural crest or mesodermal cell was marked before migration into the pharynx, its progeny dispersed but generally remained confined to a single arch primordium. Such segmental restrictions arose first in the most rostral arches, mandibular and hyoid, and progressed caudally. The phenotypes of progeny generated by single cells were examined in the mandibular arch. Clones derived from premigratory neural crest cells generally did not contribute to more than one cell type. Further, the progenitors of some cell types were spatially separated in the premigratory crest. In particular, neurogenic crest cells were situated further laterally than cells that generate cartilage and connective tissues, while pigment and glial cell progenitors were more evenly distributed. Based on these results we suggest that arch precursors may be specified as to their eventual fates before the major morphogenetic movements that form the arch primordia. Further, cell movements are restricted during segmentation establishing a group of arch precursors as a unit of developmental patterning, as in the fashion of vertebrate rhombomeres or segmental lineage compartments in Drosophila.},

Recent studies identified numerous copy number variants (CNV) and some are common polymorphisms that may contribute to disease susceptibility. We developed, and experimentally validated, a novel computational framework (QuantiSNP) for detecting regions of copy number variation from BeadArray SNP genotyping data using an Objective Bayes Hidden-Markov Model (OB-HMM). Objective Bayes measures are used to set certain hyperparameters in the priors using a novel re-sampling framework to calibrate the model to a fixed Type I (false positive) error rate. Other parameters are set via maximum marginal likelihood to prior training data of known structure. QuantiSNP provides probabilistic quantification of state classifications and significantly improves the accuracy of segmental aneuploidy identification and mapping, relative to existing analytical tools (Beadstudio, Illumina), as demonstrated by validation of breakpoint boundaries. QuantiSNP identified both novel and validated CNVs. QuantiSNP was developed using BeadArray SNP data but it can be adapted to other platforms and we believe that the OB-HMM framework has widespread applicability in genomic research. In conclusion, QuantiSNP is a novel algorithm for high-resolution CNV/aneuploidy detection with application to clinical genetics, cancer and disease association studies.},

	abstract = {Within our bodies we have stem cells that are responsible for maintaining many of our tissues in a healthy state and healing wounds after an injury. When these adult stem cells divide, they can produce daughter cells. Through a process called differentiation, these daughter cells can become mature cells that replace old or damaged cells. However, the stem cells also produce copies of themselves – in a process known as self-renewal – to ensure that an organ does not run out of stem cells. The rates of differentiation and self-renewal must be carefully balanced: too much differentiation can eventually lead to the degeneration of the tissue, whereas too much self-renewal can cause tumors to develop. One of the main questions in the stem cell field is how tissues and organs balance these opposing processes. The fruit fly mid-gut is a model system for investigating this question, and is similar to the intestine of mammals. The mid-gut is composed of three main cell types: intestinal stem cells, enteroblasts (immediate daughter cells of the stem cells) and enterocytes (fully differentiated, mature cells). Previously published data showed that a protein called Sox21a is present in the intestinal stem cells and enteroblasts, but not in the mature enterocytes. To investigate the role of Sox21a in more detail, Chen et al. deleted the gene that produces Sox21a in fruit flies. These mutant flies developed tumors in their guts, indicating that Sox21a is a tumor suppressor. Further experiments revealed that Sox21a normally drives enteroblasts to differentiate into enterocytes, and also prevents the enteroblasts from communicating with the stem cells to indicate that more enteroblasts are needed. In further experiments, Chen et al. gave otherwise healthy fruit flies a drug that injured their guts. This caused Sox21a activity to decrease temporarily, allowing more enteroblasts to be produced from intestinal stem cells to repair the damage. The mid-gut therefore has an intricate “feedback amplification” system that maintains an appropriate number of each type of cell. In future, other experiments will be needed to determine whether similar feedback amplification systems are found in other tissues, and to investigate the extent to which these systems are found in mammals. Furthermore, understanding this process in more depth could increase our knowledge about how cancerous tumors grow.},

	abstract = {Imatinib mesylate induces complete cytogenetic responses in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), yet many patients have detectable BCR-ABL transcripts in peripheral blood even after prolonged therapy. Bone marrow studies have shown that this residual disease resides within the stem cell compartment. Quiescence of leukemic stem cells has been suggested as a mechanism conferring insensitivity to imatinib, and exposure to the Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF), together with imatinib, has led to a significant reduction in leukemic stem cells in vitro. In this paper, we design a novel mathematical model of stem cell quiescence to investigate the treatment response to imatinib and G-CSF. We find that the addition of G-CSF to an imatinib treatment protocol leads to observable effects only if the majority of leukemic stem cells are quiescent; otherwise it does not modulate the leukemic cell burden. The latter scenario is in agreement with clinical findings in a pilot study administering imatinib continuously or intermittently, with or without G-CSF (GIMI trial). Furthermore, our model predicts that the addition of G-CSF leads to a higher risk of resistance since it increases the production of cycling leukemic stem cells. Although the pilot study did not include enough patients to draw any conclusion with statistical significance, there were more cases of progression in the experimental arms as compared to continuous imatinib. Our results suggest that the additional use of G-CSF may be detrimental to patients in the clinic.},

	abstract = {As an animal embryo develops, cells divide and establish three distinct layers called the ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. Proteins called transcription factors control this process by regulating the activity of particular genes. Two or more transcription factors may interact to modulate each other’s activity. Zebrafish embryos provide an ideal model system for monitoring how these embryonic layers form and the interactions between transcription factors in real-time because they are transparent and develop outside their parents. Pou5f3 and Nanog are two key transcription factors involved in this process in zebrafish. However, it is not clear how Pou5f3 and Nanog instruct cells to become ectoderm, mesoderm or endoderm. Perez Camps et al. used imaging techniques to study Pou5f3 and Nanog. The experiments show that Pou5f3 and Nanog bind together to form complexes that instruct cells to form the temporary layer that later gives rise to both the mesoderm and endoderm. The cells in which there are less Pou5f3 and Nanog complexes form the ectoderm layer. To develop the body shape of adult zebrafish, the embryos need to give individual cells information about their location in the body. For example, a signal protein called bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) accumulates on the side of the embryo that will become the underside of the fish. Perez Camps et al. show that once the endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm have formed, Pou5f3–Nanog complexes regulate BMP signalling to specify the underside of the fish. Meanwhile, in the endoderm on the opposite side, another transcription factor called Sox32 binds to individual Pou5f3 and Nanog proteins. This prevents Pou5f3 and Nanog from forming complexes and determines which side of the embryo will make the topside of the fish. A future challenge is to explore other transcription factors that may prevent Pou5f1 and Nanog from binding in the mesoderm and ectoderm of the topside of the fish.},

	abstract = {Blood perfusion in tumors can be significantly lower than that in the surrounding normal tissue owing to the leakiness and/or compression of tumor blood vessels. Impaired perfusion reduces oxygen supply and results in a hypoxic microenvironment. Hypoxia promotes tumor progression and immunosuppression, and enhances the invasive and metastatic potential of cancer cells. Furthermore, poor perfusion lowers the delivery of systemically administered drugs. Therapeutic strategies to improve perfusion include reduction in vascular permeability by vascular normalization and vascular decompression by alleviating physical forces (solid stress) inside tumors. Both strategies have shown promise, but guidelines on how to use these strategies optimally are lacking. To this end, we developed a mathematical model to guide the optimal use of these strategies. The model accounts for vascular, transvascular, and interstitial fluid and drug transport as well as the diameter and permeability of tumor vessels. Model simulations reveal an optimal perfusion region when vessels are uncompressed, but not very leaky. Within this region, intratumoral distribution of drugs is optimized, particularly for drugs 10 nm in diameter or smaller and of low binding affinity. Therefore, treatments should modify vessel diameter and/or permeability such that perfusion is optimal. Vascular normalization is more effective for hyperpermeable but largely uncompressed vessels (e.g., glioblastomas), whereas solid stress alleviation is more beneficial for compressed but less-permeable vessels (e.g., pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas). In the case of tumors with hyperpermeable and compressed vessels (e.g., subset of mammary carcinomas), the two strategies need to be combined for improved treatment outcomes.},

E-cadherin mediates cell-cell adhesion and plays a critical role in the formation and maintenance of junctional contacts between cells. Loss of E-cadherin-mediated adhesion is a key feature of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. beta-catenin is an intracellular protein associated with the actin cytoskeleton of a cell. E-cadherins bind to beta-catenin to form a complex which can interact both with neighboring cells to form bonds, and with the cytoskeleton of the cell. When cells detach from one another, beta-catenin is released into the cytoplasm, targeted for degradation, and downregulated. In this process there are multiple protein-complexes involved which interact with beta-catenin and E-cadherin. Within a mathematical individual-based multiscale model, we are able to explain experimentally observed patterns solely by a variation of cell-cell adhesive interactions. Implications for cell migration and cancer invasion are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Regenerative cycling of hair follicles offers an unique opportunity to explore the role of circadian clock in physiological tissue regeneration. We focused on the role of circadian clock in actively proliferating transient amplifying cells, as opposed to quiescent stem cells. We identified two key sites of peripheral circadian clock activity specific to regenerating anagen hair follicles, namely epithelial matrix and mesenchymal dermal papilla. We showed that peripheral circadian clock in epithelial matrix cells generates prominent daily mitotic rhythm. As a consequence of this mitotic rhythmicity, hairs grow faster in the morning than in the evening. Because cells are the most susceptible to DNA damage during mitosis, this cycle leads to a remarkable time-of-day-dependent sensitivity of growing hair follicles to genotoxic stress. Same doses of γ-radiation caused dramatic hair loss in wild-type mice when administered in the morning, during mitotic peak, compared with the evening, when hair loss is minimal. This diurnal radioprotective effect becomes lost in circadian mutants, consistent with asynchronous mitoses in their hair follicles. Clock coordinates cell cycle progression with genotoxic stress responses by synchronizing Cdc2/Cyclin B-mediated G2/M checkpoint. Our results uncover diurnal mitotic gating as the essential protective mechanism in highly proliferative hair follicles and offer strategies for minimizing or maximizing cytotoxicity of radiation therapies.},

People then decide whether the other is competent to enact those intents. Perception of scientists, like other social perceptions, involves inferring both their apparent intent (warmth) and capability (competence). To illustrate, we polled adults online about typical American jobs, rated as American society views them, on warmth and competence dimensions, as well as relevant emotions. Ambivalently perceived high-competence but low-warmth, "envied" professions included lawyers, chief executive officers, engineers, accountants, scientists, and researchers. Being seen as competent but cold might not seem problematic until one recalls that communicator credibility requires not just status and expertise but also trustworthiness (warmth). Other research indicates the risk from being enviable. Turning to a case study of scientific communication, another online sample of adults described public attitudes toward climate scientists specifically. Although distrust is low, the apparent motive to gain research money is distrusted. The literature on climate science communicators agrees that the public trusts impartiality, not persuasive agendas. Overall, communicator credibility needs to address both expertise and trustworthiness. Scientists have earned audiences' respect, but not necessarily their trust. Discussing, teaching, and sharing information can earn trust to show scientists' trustworthy intentions.},

Signalling between these populations regulates nephron progenitor maintenance, branching morphogenesis and nephron induction. Nephron endowment is sensitive to changes in the size of the nephron progenitor pool and to decreases in factors that promote branching morphogenesis. However, determining the morphogenic consequences of these disruptions in vivo has been challenging as quantitating kidney morphogenesis is hampered by the size, opacity and three-dimensional complexity of the tissue. The recent application of whole mount immunofluorescence and tissue clearing, coupled with multiscale imaging and quantitative analysis, has begun to give insights into the dynamics of kidney formation. This review focuses on how the quantitative nature of this approach has enabled mathematical modelling of cell cycle lengths, growth rates, cell number and branching rates and is advancing our understanding of kidney organogenesis.},

By recombining cells from the ventral skin of the \textit{K14-PTHrP} transgenic mice [which overexpress parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) in their developing epidermis and mammary glands] with those from wild type, we show that transgenic stroma is sufficient to reprogram wild-type keratinocytes into nipple-like epidermis. To identify candidate nipple-specific signaling factors, we compared gene expression signatures of sorted Pdgfrα-positive ventral \textit{K14-PTHrP} and wild-type fibroblasts, identifying differentially expressed transcripts that are involved in WNT, HGF, TGF$\beta$, IGF, BMP, FGF and estrogen signaling. Considering that some of the growth factor pathways are targets for estrogen regulation, we examined the upstream role of this hormone in maintaining the nipple. Ablation of estrogen signaling through ovariectomy produced nipples with abnormally thin epidermis, and we identified TGF$\beta$ as a negatively regulated target of estrogen signaling. Estrogen treatment represses Tgf$\beta$1 at the transcript and protein levels in \textit{K14-PTHrP} fibroblasts \textit{in vitro}, while ovariectomy increases \textit{Tgf}\textit{b}\textit{1} levels in \textit{K14-PTHrP} ventral skin. Moreover, ectopic delivery of Tgf$\beta$1 protein into nipple connective tissue reduced epidermal proliferation. Taken together, these results show that specialized nipple epidermis is maintained by estrogen-induced repression of TGF$\beta$ signaling in the local fibroblasts.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The results from many in-depth analyses and genome-scale surveys have suggested how such fluctuations arise and spread, often in ways consistent with stochastic models of transcription and translation. But fluctuations also arise during cell division when molecules are partitioned stochastically between the two daughters. Here we mathematically demonstrate how stochastic partitioning contributes to the non-genetic heterogeneity. Our results show that partitioning errors are hard to correct, and that the resulting noise profiles are remarkably difficult to separate from gene expression noise. By applying these results to common experimental strategies and distinguishing between creation versus transmission of noise, we hypothesize that much of the cell-to-cell heterogeneity that has been attributed to various aspects of gene expression instead comes from random segregation at cell division. We propose experiments to separate between these two types of fluctuations and discuss future directions.},

Aberrant methylation patterns occur in several inherited human diseases and in many cancers. To understand how methylated and unmethylated states of cytosine residues are transmitted during DNA replication, we develop a population-epigenetic model of DNA methylation dynamics. The model is informed by our observation that de novo methylation can occur on the daughter strand while leaving the opposing cytosine unmethylated, as revealed by the patterns of methylation on the two complementary strands of individual DNA molecules. Under our model, we can infer site-specific rates of both maintenance and de novo methylation, values that determine the fidelity of methylation inheritance, from double-stranded methylation data. This approach can be used for populations of cells obtained from individuals without the need for cell culture. We use our method to infer cytosine methylation rates at several sites within the promoter of the human gene FMR1.},

	abstract = {Malignant mouse teratocarcinoma (or embryonal carcinoma) cells with a normal modal chromosome number were taken from the "cores" of embryoid bodies grown only in vivo as an ascites tumor for 8 years, and were injected into blastocysts bearing many genetic markers, in order to test the developmental capacities, genetic constitution, and reversibility of malignancy of the core cells. Ninety-three live normal pre- and postnatal animals were obtained. Of 14 thus far analyzed, three were cellular genetic mosaics with substantial contributions of tumor-derived cells in many developmentally unrelated tissues, including some never seen in the solid tumors that form in transplant hosts. The tissues functioned normally and synthesized their specific products (e.g., immunoglobulins, adult hemoglobin, liver proteins) coded for by strain-type alleles at known loci. In addition, a tumor-contributed color gene, steel, not previously known to be present in the carcinoma cells, was detected from the coat phenotype. Cells derived from the carcinoma, which is of X/Y sex chromosome constitution, also contributed to the germ line and formed reproductively functional sperms, some of which transmitted the steel gene to the progeny. Thus, after almost 200 transplant generations as a highly malignant tumor, embryoid body core cells appear to be developmentally totipotent and able to express, in an orderly sequence in differentiation of somatic and germ-line tissues, many genes hitherto silent in the tumor of origin. This experimental system of "cycling" teratocarcinoma core cells through mice, in conjunction with experimental mutagenesis of those cells, may therefore provide a new and useful tool for biochemical, developmental, and genetic analyses of mammalian differentiation. The results also furnish an unequivocal example in animals of a non-mutational basis for transformation to malignancy and of reversal to normalcy. The origin of this tumor from a disorganized embryo suggests that malignancies of some other, more specialized, stem cells might arise comparably through tissue disorganization, leading to developmental aberrations of gene expression rather than changes in gene structure.},

Addition of a soluble form of human Jagged-1 to cultures of purified primitive human blood cells had modest effects in augmenting cytokine-induced proliferation of progenitors. However, intravenous transplantation of cultured cells into immunodeficient mice revealed that human (h)Jagged-1 induces the survival and expansion of human stem cells capable of pluripotent repopulating capacity.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) can self-renew indefinitely while maintaining the ability to generate all cell types of the body. This plasticity is proposed to require heterogeneity in gene expression, driving a metastable state which may allow flexible cell fate choices. Contrary to this, naive PSC grown in fully defined 92i9 environmental conditions, containing small molecule inhibitors of MEK and GSK3 kinases, show homogenous pluripotency and lineage marker expression. However, here we show that 2i induces greater genome-wide heterogeneity than traditional serum-containing growth environments at the population level across both male and female PSCs. This heterogeneity is dynamic and reversible over time, consistent with a dynamic metastable equilibrium of the pluripotent state. We further show that the 2i environment causes increased heterogeneity in the calcium signalling pathway at both the population and single-cell level. Mechanistically, we identify loss of robustness regulators in the form of negative feedback to the upstream EGF receptor. Our findings advance the current understanding of the plastic nature of the pluripotent state and highlight the role of signalling pathways in the control of transcriptional heterogeneity. Furthermore, our results have critical implications for the current use of kinase inhibitors in the clinic, where inducing heterogeneity may increase the risk of cancer metastasis and drug resistance.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Wnt genes encode a large family of secreted, cysteine-rich proteins that play key roles as intercellular signaling molecules in development. Genetic studies in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans, ectopic gene expression in Xenopus, and gene knockouts in the mouse have demonstrated the involvement of Wnts in processes as diverse as segmentation, CNS patterning, and control of asymmetric cell divisions. The transduction of Wnt signals between cells proceeds in a complex series of events including post-translational modification and secretion of Wnts, binding to transmembrane receptors, activation of cytoplasmic effectors, and, finally, transcriptional regulation of target genes. Over the past two years our understanding of Wnt signaling has been substantially improved by the identification of Frizzled proteins as cell surface receptors for Wnts and by the finding that beta-catenin, a component downstream of the receptor, can translocate to the nucleus and function as a transcriptional activator. Here we review recent data that have started to unravel the mechanisms of Wnt signaling.},

	abstract = {It is currently thought that life-long blood cell production is driven by the action of a small number of multipotent haematopoietic stem cells. Evidence supporting this view has been largely acquired through the use of functional assays involving transplantation. However, whether these mechanisms also govern native non-transplant haematopoiesis is entirely unclear. Here we have established a novel experimental model in mice where cells can be uniquely and genetically labelled in situ to address this question. Using this approach, we have performed longitudinal analyses of clonal dynamics in adult mice that reveal unprecedented features of native haematopoiesis. In contrast to what occurs following transplantation, steady-state blood production is maintained by the successive recruitment of thousands of clones, each with a minimal contribution to mature progeny. Our results demonstrate that a large number of long-lived progenitors, rather than classically defined haematopoietic stem cells, are the main drivers of steady-state haematopoiesis during most of adulthood. Our results also have implications for understanding the cellular origin of haematopoietic disease.},

	abstract = {Blood stem cells and blood progenitor cells replenish a person’s entire blood system throughout their life and are crucial for survival. The stem cells have the potential to become any type of blood cell – including white blood cells and red blood cells – while the progenitor cells are slightly more restricted in the types of blood cell they can become. It is important to understand how the balance of cell types is maintained because, in cancers of the blood (also known as leukaemias), this organisation is lost and some cells proliferate abnormally. Almost all of a person’s cells will contain the same genetic information, but different cell types arise when different genes are switched on or off. The genes encoding proteins called transcription factors are particularly important because the proteins can control – either by activating or repressing – many other genes. Importantly, some of these genes will encode other transcription factors, meaning that these proteins essentially work together in networks. Schütte et al. have now combined extensive biochemical experiments with computational modelling to study some of the transcription factors that define blood stem cells and blood progenitor cells in mice. Firstly, nine transcription factors, which were already known to be important in blood stem cells, were thoroughly studied in mouse cells that could be grown in the laboratory. These experiments provided an overall view of which other genes these transcription factors control. Additional targeted investigations of the nine transcription factors then revealed how these proteins act in combination to activate or repress their respective activities. With this information, Schütte et al. built a computational model, which accurately reproduced how real mouse blood stem and progenitor cells behave when, for example, a transcription factor is deleted. Furthermore, the model could also predict what happens in single cells if the amounts of the transcription factors change. Lastly, Schütte et al. studied a common type of leukaemia. The model showed that the mutations that occur in this cancer change the finely tuned balance of the nine transcription factors; this may explain why leukaemia cells behave abnormally. In future these models could be extended to more transcription factors and other cell types and cancers.},

Here, we describe a statistical thermodynamic model of gene regulation that combines the activity of a morphogen with the transcriptional network it controls. Using Sonic hedgehog (Shh) patterning of the ventral neural tube as an example, we show that the framework can be used together with the principled parameter selection technique of approximate Bayesian computation to obtain a dynamical model that accurately predicts tissue patterning. The analysis indicates that, for each target gene regulated by Gli, which is the transcriptional effector of Shh signalling, there is a neutral point in the gradient, either side of which altering the Gli binding affinity has opposite effects on gene expression. This explains recent counterintuitive experimental observations. The approach is broadly applicable and provides a unifying framework to explain the temporospatial pattern of morphogen-regulated gene expression.},

These stem cells have been variously described as rapidly cycling or quiescent. A functional arrangement of stem cells that reconciles both of these behaviours has so far been difficult to obtain. Alternative explanations for quiescent cells have been that they act as a parallel or reserve population that replace rapidly cycling stem cells periodically or after injury; their exact nature remains unknown. Here we show mouse intestinal quiescent cells to be precursors that are committed to mature into differentiated secretory cells of the Paneth and enteroendocrine lineage. However, crucially we find that after intestinal injury they are capable of extensive proliferation and can give rise to clones comprising the main epithelial cell types. Thus, quiescent cells can be recalled to the stem-cell state. These findings establish quiescent cells as an effective clonogenic reserve and provide a motivation for investigating their role in pathologies such as colorectal cancers and intestinal inflammation.},

Deep sequencing was performed on peripheral blood DNA of these cases and compared to age-matched controls that did not develop AML. We discovered that mutations in IDH1, IDH2, TP53, DNMT3A, TET2 and spliceosome genes significantly increased the odds of developing AML. All subjects with TP53 mutations (n = 21 out of 21 patients) and IDH1 and IDH2 (n = 15 out of 15 patients) mutations eventually developed AML in our study.

Calcium oscillations following T-cell activation are familiar to all immunologists, and metabolic and reactive oxygen species oscillations in neutrophils have been well documented. More recently, oscillations in nuclear factor kappaB activity following stimulation by tumor necrosis factor alpha have received considerable publicity. However, despite all of these examples, oscillations in the immune system still tend to be considered mainly as pathological aberrations, and their causes and significance remained largely unknown. This is partly because of a lack of awareness within the immunological community of the appropriate theoretical frameworks for describing and analyzing such behavior. We provide an introduction to these frameworks and give a survey of the currently known oscillations that occur within the immune system.},

	abstract = {The substantial spatial and temporal heterogeneity observed in patient tumors poses considerable challenges for the design of effective drug combinations with predictable outcomes. Currently, the implications of tissue heterogeneity and sampling bias during diagnosis are unclear for selection and subsequent performance of potential combination therapies. Here, we apply a multiobjective computational optimization approach integrated with empirical information on efficacy and toxicity for individual drugs with respect to a spectrum of genetic perturbations, enabling derivation of optimal drug combinations for heterogeneous tumors comprising distributions of subpopulations possessing these perturbations. Analysis across probabilistic samplings from the spectrum of various possible distributions reveals that the most beneficial (considering both efficacy and toxicity) set of drugs changes as the complexity of genetic heterogeneity increases. Importantly, a significant likelihood arises that a drug selected as the most beneficial single agent with respect to the predominant subpopulation in fact does not reside within the most broadly useful drug combinations for heterogeneous tumors. The underlying explanation appears to be that heterogeneity essentially homogenizes the benefit of drug combinations, reducing the special advantage of a particular drug on a specific subpopulation. Thus, this study underscores the importance of considering heterogeneity in choosing drug combinations and offers a principled approach toward designing the most likely beneficial set, even if the subpopulation distribution is not precisely known.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Simulation of sophisticated biological models requires considerable computational power. These models typically integrate together numerous biological phenomena such as spatially-explicit heterogeneous cells, cell-cell interactions, cell-environment interactions and intracellular gene networks. The recent advent of programming for graphical processing units (GPU) opens up the possibility of developing more integrative, detailed and predictive biological models while at the same time decreasing the computational cost to simulate those models. RESULTS:We construct a 3D model of epidermal development and provide a set of GPU algorithms that executes significantly faster than sequential central processing unit (CPU) code. We provide a parallel implementation of the subcellular element method for individual cells residing in a lattice-free spatial environment. Each cell in our epidermal model includes an internal gene network, which integrates cellular interaction of Notch signaling together with environmental interaction of basement membrane adhesion, to specify cellular state and behaviors such as growth and division. We take a pedagogical approach to describing how modeling methods are efficiently implemented on the GPU including memory layout of data structures and functional decomposition. We discuss various programmatic issues and provide a set of design guidelines for GPU programming that are instructive to avoid common pitfalls as well as to extract performance from the GPU architecture. CONCLUSIONS:We demonstrate that GPU algorithms represent a significant technological advance for the simulation of complex biological models. We further demonstrate with our epidermal model that the integration of multiple complex modeling methods for heterogeneous multicellular biological processes is both feasible and computationally tractable using this new technology. We hope that the provided algorithms and source code will be a starting point for modelers to develop their own GPU implementations, and encourage others to implement their modeling methods on the GPU and to make that code available to the wider community.},

	abstract = {Transport of cells and biochemical molecules often takes place in crowded, heterogeneous environments. As such, it is important we understand how to quantify crowded transport phenomena, and the possibilities of extracting transport coefficients from limited observations. We employ a volume-excluding random walk model on a square lattice where different fractions of lattice sites are filled with inert, immobile obstacles to investigate whether it is possible to estimate parameters associated with transport when crowding is present. By collecting and analysing data obtained on multiple spatial scales we demonstrate that commonly used models of motility within crowded environments can be used to reliably predict our random walk data. However, infeasibly large amounts of data are needed to estimate transport parameters, and quantitative estimates may differ depending on the spatial scale on which they are collected. We also demonstrate that in models of crowded environments there is a relatively large region of the parameter space within which it is difficult to distinguish between the "best fit" parameter values. This suggests commonly used descriptions of transport within crowded systems may not be appropriate, and that we should be careful in choosing models to represent the effects of crowding upon motility within biochemical systems.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION:Combinatorial interactions of transcription factors with cis-regulatory elements control the dynamic progression through successive cellular states and thus underpin all metazoan development. The construction of network models of cis-regulatory elements, therefore, has the potential to generate fundamental insights into cellular fate and differentiation. Haematopoiesis has long served as a model system to study mammalian differentiation, yet modelling based on experimentally informed cis-regulatory interactions has so far been restricted to pairs of interacting factors. Here, we have generated a Boolean network model based on detailed cis-regulatory functional data connecting 11 haematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) regulator genes. RESULTS:Despite its apparent simplicity, the model exhibits surprisingly complex behaviour that we charted using strongly connected components and shortest-path analysis in its Boolean state space. This analysis of our model predicts that HSPCs display heterogeneous expression patterns and possess many intermediate states that can act as 'stepping stones' for the HSPC to achieve a final differentiated state. Importantly, an external perturbation or 'trigger' is required to exit the stem cell state, with distinct triggers characterizing maturation into the various different lineages. By focusing on intermediate states occurring during erythrocyte differentiation, from our model we predicted a novel negative regulation of Fli1 by Gata1, which we confirmed experimentally thus validating our model. In conclusion, we demonstrate that an advanced mammalian regulatory network model based on experimentally validated cis-regulatory interactions has allowed us to make novel, experimentally testable hypotheses about transcriptional mechanisms that control differentiation of mammalian stem cells.

We consider the mechanical effects that drive swelling of brain tissue slices in an ionic solution bath, motivated by recent experimental results that showed that the volume change of tissue slices depends on the ionic concentration of the bathing solution. This result was attributed to the presence of large charged molecules that induce ion concentration gradients to ensure electroneutrality (the Donnan effect), leading to osmotic pressures and water accumulation. We use a mathematical triphasic model for soft tissue to characterize the underlying processes that could lead to the volume changes observed experimentally. We suggest that swelling is caused by an osmotic pressure increase driven by both non-permeating solutes released by necrotic cells, in addition to the Donnan effect. Both effects are necessary to explain the dependence of the tissue slice volume on the ionic bath concentration that was observed experimentally.},

	abstract = {Analysis of cell motility effects in physiological processes can be facilitated by a mathematical model capable of simulating individual cell movement paths. A quantitative description of motility of individual cells would be useful, for example, in the study of the formation of new blood vessel networks in angiogenesis by microvessel endothelial cell (MEC) migration. In this paper we propose a stochastic mathematical model for the random motility and chemotaxis of single cells, and evaluate migration paths of MEC in terms of this model. In our model, cell velocity under random motility conditions is described as a persistent random walk using the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (O-U) process. Two parameters quantify this process: the magnitude of random movement accelerations, alpha, and a decay rate constant for movement velocity, beta. Two other quantities often used in measurements of individual cell random motility properties–cell speed, S, and persistence time in velocity, Pv–can be defined in terms of the fundamental stochastic parameters alpha and beta by: S =square root (alpha/beta) and Pv = 1/beta. We account for chemotactic cell movement in chemoattractant gradients by adding a directional bias term to the O-U process. The magnitude of the directional bias is characterized by the chemotactic responsiveness, kappa. A critical advantage of the proposed model is that it can generate, using experimentally measured values of alpha, beta and kappa, computer simulations of theoretical individual cell paths for use in evaluating the role of cell migration in specific physiological processes. We have used the model to assess MEC migration in the presence of absence of the angiogenic stimulus acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF). Time-lapse video was used to observe and track the paths of cells moving in various media, and the mean square displacement was measured from these paths. To test the validity of the model, we compared the mean square displacement measurements of each cell with model predictions of that displacement. The comparison indicates that the O-U process provides a satisfactory description of the random migration at this level of comparison. Using nonlinear regression in these comparisons, we measured the magnitude of random accelerations, alpha, and the velocity decay rate constant, beta, for each cell path. We consequently obtained values for the derived quantities, speed and persistence time. In control medium, we find that alpha = 250 +/- 100 microns 2h-3 and beta = 0.22 +/- 0.03h-1, while in stimulus medium (control plus unpurified aFGF) alpha = 1900 +/- 720 microns 2h-3 and beta = 0.99 +/- 0.37h-1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	abstract = {During development, hematopoietic cells originate from endothelium in a process known as endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT). To study human EHT, we coupled flow cytometry and single-cell transcriptional analyses of human pluripotent stem cell-derived CD34$^{\textrm{+}}$ cells. The resulting transcriptional hierarchy showed a continuum of endothelial and hematopoietic signatures. At the interface of these two signatures, a unique group of cells displayed both an endothelial signature and high levels of key hematopoietic stem cell-associated genes. This interphase group was validated via sort and subculture as an immediate precursor to hematopoietic cells. Differential expression analyses further divided this population into subgroups, which, upon subculture, showed distinct hematopoietic lineage differentiation potentials. We therefore propose that immediate precursors to hematopoietic cells already have their hematopoietic lineage restrictions defined prior to complete downregulation of the endothelial signature. These findings increase our understanding of the processes of de novo hematopoietic cell generation in the human developmental context.},

As Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) functions in many of the same processes, we investigated a role for APC in the regulation of GSK-3-dependent signaling. We find that APC directly enhances GSK-3 activity. Furthermore, knockdown of APC mimics inhibition of GSK-3 by reducing phosphorylation of glycogen synthase and by activating mTOR, revealing novel roles for APC in the regulation of these enzymes. Wnt signaling inhibits GSK-3 through an unknown mechanism, and this results in both stabilization of $\beta$-catenin and activation of mTOR. We therefore hypothesized that Wnts may regulate GSK-3 by disrupting the interaction between APC and the Axin-GSK-3 complex. We find that Wnts rapidly induce APC dissociation from Axin, correlating with $\beta$-catenin stabilization. Furthermore, Axin interaction with the Wnt co-receptor LRP6 causes APC dissociation from Axin. We propose that APC regulates multiple signaling pathways by enhancing GSK-3 activity, and that Wnts induce APC dissociation from Axin to reduce GSK-3 activity and activate downstream signaling. APC regulation of GSK-3 also provides a novel mechanism for Wnt regulation of multiple downstream effectors, including $\beta$-catenin and mTOR.},

	abstract = {How does education affect cortical organization? All literate adults possess a region specialized for letter strings, the visual word form area (VWFA), within the mosaic of ventral regions involved in processing other visual categories such as objects, places, faces, or body parts. Therefore, the acquisition of literacy may induce a reorientation of cortical maps towards letters at the expense of other categories such as faces. To test this cortical recycling hypothesis, we studied how the visual cortex of individual children changes during the first months of reading acquisition. Ten 6-year-old children were scanned longitudinally 6 or 7 times with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before and throughout the first year of school. Subjects were exposed to a variety of pictures (words, numbers, tools, houses, faces, and bodies) while performing an unrelated target-detection task. Behavioral assessment indicated a sharp rise in grapheme–phoneme knowledge and reading speed in the first trimester of school. Concurrently, voxels specific to written words and digits emerged at the VWFA location. The responses to other categories remained largely stable, although right-hemispheric face-related activity increased in proportion to reading scores. Retrospective examination of the VWFA voxels prior to reading acquisition showed that reading encroaches on voxels that are initially weakly specialized for tools and close to but distinct from those responsive to faces. Remarkably, those voxels appear to keep their initial category selectivity while acquiring an additional and stronger responsivity to words. We propose a revised model of the neuronal recycling process in which new visual categories invade weakly specified cortex while leaving previously stabilized cortical responses unchanged.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Reaction–diffusion models describing the movement, reproduction and death of individuals within a population are key mathematical modelling tools with widespread applications in mathematical biology. A diverse range of such continuum models have been applied in various biological contexts by choosing different flux and source terms in the reaction–diffusion framework. For example, to describe collective spreading of cell populations, the flux term may be chosen to reflect various movement mechanisms, such as random motion (diffusion), adhesion, haptotaxis, chemokinesis and chemotaxis. The choice of flux terms in specific applications, such as wound healing, is usually made heuristically, and rarely is it tested quantitatively against detailed cell density data. More generally, in mathematical biology, the questions of model validation and model selection have not received the same attention as the questions of model development and model analysis. Many studies do not consider model validation or model selection, and those that do often base the selection of the model on residual error criteria after model calibration is performed using nonlinear regression techniques. In this work, we present a model selection case study, in the context of cell invasion, with a very detailed experimental data set. Using Bayesian analysis and information criteria, we demonstrate that model selection and model validation should account for both residual errors and model complexity. These considerations are often overlooked in the mathematical biology literature. The results we present here provide a clear methodology that can be used to guide model selection across a range of applications. Furthermore, the case study we present provides a clear example where neglecting the role of model complexity can give rise to misleading outcomes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Computational gene identification is set to play an increasingly important role in the development of the genome projects, as emphasis turns from mapping to large-scale sequencing. The evaluation presented here serves both to assess the current status of the problem and to identify the most promising approaches to ensure further progress. The programs analyzed were uniformly tested on a large set of vertebrate sequences with simple gene structure, and several measures of predictive accuracy were computed at the nucleotide, exon, and protein product levels. The results indicated that the predictive accuracy of the programs analyzed was lower than originally found. The accuracy was even lower when considering only those sequences that had recently been entered and that did not show any similarity to previously entered sequences. This indicates that the programs are overly dependent on the particularities of the examples they learn from. For most of the programs, accuracy in this test set ranged from 0.60 to 0.70 as measured by the Correlation Coefficient (where 1.0 corresponds to a perfect prediction and 0.0 is the value expected for a random prediction), and the average percentage of exons exactly identified was less than 50\%. Only those programs including protein sequence database searches showed substantially greater accuracy. The accuracy of the programs was severely affected by relatively high rates of sequence errors. Since the set on which the programs were tested included only relatively short sequences with simple gene structure, the accuracy of the programs is likely to be even lower when used for large uncharacterized genomic sequences with complex structure. While in such cases, programs currently available may still be of great use in pinpointing the regions likely to contain exons, they are far from being powerful enough to elucidate its genomic structure completely.},

	abstract = {Many sophisticated computer programs use random number generators to help solve challenging problems. These problems range from achieving secure communication across the Internet to deciding how best to invest in the stock market. Much research in recent years has found that randomness is also widespread in living cells, where it is often called “noise”. For example, the activity of some genes is so unpredictable to the extent that it appears random. Yet, relatively little is known about how such gene-expression noise propagates up to change how the cell behaves. Many open questions also remain about how cells might exploit these or other fluctuations to achieve complex tasks, like people use random number generators. Bacteria perform a number of complex tasks. Some bacteria will swim toward chemicals that suggest a potential reward, such as food. Yet they swim away from chemicals that could lead them to harm. This ability is called chemotaxis and it relies on a network of interacting enzymes and other proteins that coordinates a bacterium’s movements with the input from its senses. Keegstra et al. set out to find sources of noise that might act as random number generators and help the bacterium E. coli to best perform chemotaxis. An improved version of a technique called in vivo Förster resonance energy transfer (or in vivo FRET for short) was used to give a detectable signal when two proteins involved in the chemotaxis network interacted inside a single bacterium. The experiments showed that this protein network amplifies gene-expression noise for some genes while lessening it for others. In addition, the interactions between proteins encoded by genes acted as an extra source of noise, even when gene-expression noise was eliminated. Keegstra et al. found that the amount of signaling within the chemotaxis network, as measured by in vivo FRET, varied wildly over time. This revealed two sources of noise at the level of protein signaling. One was due to randomness in the activity of the enzymes involved in tuning the cell’s sensitivity to changes in its environment. The other was due to protein interactions within a large complex that acts as the cell’s sensor. Unexpectedly, this second source of noise under some conditions could be so strong that it flipped the output of the cell’s signaling network back and forth between just two states: “on” and “off”. Together these findings uncover how signaling networks can not only amplify or lessen gene-expression noise, but can themselves become a source of random events. The new knowledge of how such random events interact with a complex trait in a living cell – namely chemotaxis – could aid future antimicrobial strategies, because many bacteria use chemotaxis to help them establish infections. More generally, the new insights about noise in protein networks could help engineers seeking to build synthetic biochemical networks or produce useful compounds in living cells.},

In this paper, we identify a threshold in the rate and timing of initiator caspase activation that distinguishes cells that live from those that die; by mapping this threshold, we can predict fractional killing of cells exposed to natural and synthetic agonists alone or in combination with sensitizing drugs such as bortezomib. A phenomenological model of the threshold also quantifies the contributions of two resistance genes (c-FLIP and Bcl-2), providing new insight into the control of cell fate by opposing pro-death and pro-survival proteins and suggesting new criteria for evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic TRAIL receptor agonists. ![][1]{\textless}/img{\textgreater} Non-genetic cell-to-cell variability results in fractional killing by TRAIL and therapeutic antibody agonists, limiting their effectiveness as anti-cancer drugs. A simple model of initiator caspase dynamics reveals a threshold in caspase activity that separates dying and surviving cells. Mol Syst Biol. (2015) 11: 803 [1]: pending:yes},

	abstract = {The Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signaling pathway is critical in both cellular proliferation and organismal development. However, how the $\beta$-catenin degradation complex is inhibited upon Wnt activation remains unclear. Using a directed RNAi screen we find that protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), a ubiquitous serine/threonine phosphatase, is a novel potent positive physiologic regulator of the Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signaling pathway. PP1 expression synergistically activates, and inhibition of PP1 inhibits, Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signaling in Drosophila and mammalian cells as well as in Xenopus embryos. The data suggest that PP1 controls Wnt signaling through interaction with, and regulated dephosphorylation of, axin. Inhibition of PP1 leads to enhanced phosphorylation of specific sites on axin by casein kinase I. Axin phosphorylation markedly enhances the binding of glycogen synthase kinase 3, leading to a more active $\beta$-catenin destruction complex. Wnt-regulated changes in axin phosphorylation, mediated by PP1, may therefore determine $\beta$-catenin transcriptional activity. Specific inhibition of PP1 in this pathway may offer therapeutic approaches to disorders with increased $\beta$-catenin signaling.},

	abstract = {Helper T (Th) cells are a crucial component of the adaptive immune system and are of fundamental importance in orchestrating the appropriate response to pathogenic challenge. They fall into two broad categories defined by the cytokines each produces. Th1 cells produce interferon- gamma and are required for effective immunity to intracellular bacteria, viruses and protozoa whereas Th2 produce IL-4 and are required for optimal antibody production to T-dependent antigens. A great deal of experimental data on the regulation of Th1 and Th2 differentiation have been obtained but many essential features of this complex system are still not understood. Here we present a mathematical model of Th1/Th2 differentiation and cross regulation. We model Fas-mediated activation-induced cell death (AICD) as this process has been identified as an important mechanism for limiting clonal expansion and resolving T cell responses. We conclude that Th2 susceptibility to AICD is important for stabilizing the two polarized arms of the T helper response, and that cell-cell killing, not suicide, is the dominant mechanism for Fas-mediated death of Th1 effectors. We find that the combination of the anti-proliferative effect of the cytokine TGF- beta and the inhibiting influence of IL-10 on T cell activation are crucial controls for Th2 populations. We see that the strengths of the activation signals for each T helper cell subset, which are dependent on the antigen dose, co-stimulatory signals and the cytokine environment, critically determine the dominant helper subset. Switches from Th1- to Th2-dominance may be important in chronic infection and we show that this phenomenon can arise from differential AICD susceptibility of T helper subsets, and asymmetries in the nature of the cross-suppressive cytokine interactions. Our model suggests that in some senses a predominantly type 2 reaction may well be the "default" pathway for an antigen-specific immune response, due to these asymmetries.},

Previous studies have suggested that stem cell commitment to a specific lineage may constitute a discrete event of stochastic activation of a small number of key regulator genes. Experimental exploration of this question is challenging, in face of the elusive nature of the commitment transition and due to considerable gene expression heterogeneity between cells. Here, we implement a computational model that simulates gene expression variation through time and affords the capture of in silico commitment events. This model integrates statistical analysis of experimental single-cell gene expression data with dynamical modeling methods to implement a mechanistic framework for stochastic regulation of gene transcription and a probabilistic approach for the commitment rules. Applied to blood cells, our method identifies potential commitment-associated genes, explores how their expression patterns can define alternative commitment regimes, and suggests how differences in regulation of gene expression dynamics can impact the frequency of commitment.},

We approach this multiscale coupling problem by constraining the overall shapes of muscle cells to indirectly control the organization of their intracellular space. We hypothesized the cellular boundary conditions direct the organization of cytoskeletal scaffolds. We developed a model of how the cytoskeleton of cardiomyocytes organizes with respect to boundary cues. Our computational and experimental results to control myocyte shape indicated that distinct muscle architectures arise from two main organizational mechanisms: the interaction between actin fibers, premyofibrils and focal adhesions, as well as cooperative alignment and parallel bundling of more mature myofibrils. We show that a hierarchy of processes regulate the self-organization of cardiomyocytes. Our results suggest that a symmetry break, due to the boundary conditions imposed on the cell, is responsible for polarization of the contractile cytoskeletal organization.},

Such robust size control is achieved via tissue-level coordination of cell growth, proliferation, death and rearrangement, through mechanisms that are not well understood. Here, we employ computational modelling to test hypotheses of size control in the developing fruit fly. Segments in the surface tissues of the fruit fly embryo have been shown to achieve the same size even if the number of cells in each segment is perturbed genetically. We show that simple mechanical interactions between the cells of this tissue can recapitulate previously gathered data on tissue sizes and cell numbers. However, this simple model does not capture the experimentally observed spatial variation in cell death rates in this tissue, which may be explained through several adaptations to the model. These distinct adaptations may be distinguished through summary statistics of the tissue behaviour, such as statistics of cell shapes or tissue recoil after cutting. This work demonstrates how computational modelling can help investigate the complex mechanical interactions underlying tissue size and shape, which are important for understanding the underlying causes of birth defects and diseases driven by uncontrolled growth.},

By design, accessibility-selected fragments were highly overlapping (up to 370 per region), enabling us to pinpoint driver regulatory nucleotides by exploiting subtle differences in reporter activity between partially-overlapping fragments, using a new machine learning model SHARPR2. Our resulting maps include {\textbackslash}textasciitilde65,000 regions showing significant enhancer function and enriched for endogenous active histone marks (including H3K9ac, H3K27ac), regulatory sequence motifs, and regions bound by immune regulators. Within them, we discover {\textbackslash}textasciitilde13,000 high-resolution driver elements enriched for regulatory motifs and evolutionarily-conserved nucleotides, and help predict causal genetic variants underlying disease from genome-wide association studies. Overall, HiDRA provides a general, scalable, high-throughput, and high-resolution approach for experimental dissection of regulatory regions and driver nucleotides in the context of human biology and disease.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Neural crest (NC) cell migration is crucial to the formation of peripheral tissues during vertebrate development. However, how NC cells respond to different microenvironments to maintain persistence of direction and cohesion in multicellular streams remains unclear. To address this, we profiled eight subregions of a typical cranial NC cell migratory stream. Hierarchical clustering showed significant differences in the expression profiles of the lead three subregions compared with newly emerged cells. Multiplexed imaging of mRNA expression using fluorescent hybridization chain reaction (HCR) quantitatively confirmed the expression profiles of lead cells. Computational modeling predicted that a small fraction of lead cells that detect directional information is optimal for successful stream migration. Single-cell profiling then revealed a unique molecular signature that is consistent and stable over time in a subset of lead cells within the most advanced portion of the migratory front, which we term trailblazers. Model simulations that forced a lead cell behavior in the trailing subpopulation predicted cell bunching near the migratory domain entrance. Misexpression of the trailblazer molecular signature by perturbation of two upstream transcription factors agreed with the in silico prediction and showed alterations to NC cell migration distance and stream shape. These data are the first to characterize the molecular diversity within an NC cell migratory stream and offer insights into how molecular patterns are transduced into cell behaviors.},

	abstract = {The location of proteins within eukaryotic cells is often critical for their function and relocation of proteins forms the mainstay of regulatory pathways. To assess the importance of protein location to cellular homeostasis, we have developed a methodology to systematically create binary physical interactions between a query protein and most other members of the proteome. This method allows us to rapidly assess which of the thousands of possible protein interactions modify a phenotype. As proof of principle we studied the kinetochore, a multiprotein assembly that links centromeres to the microtubules of the spindle during cell division. In budding yeast, the kinetochores from the 16 chromosomes cluster together to a single location within the nucleus. The many proteins that make up the kinetochore are regulated through ubiquitylation and phosphorylation. By systematically associating members of the proteome to the kinetochore, we determine which fusions affect its normal function. We identify a number of candidate kinetochore regulators, including the phosphatase Cdc14. We examine where within the kinetochore Cdc14 can act and show that the effect is limited to regions that correlate with known phosphorylation sites, demonstrating the importance of serine phospho-regulation for normal kinetochore homeostasis.},

	abstract = {The evolution of biological systems is influenced by a number of factors and forces that have acted in different combinations at different times to give rise to extant organisms. Here we illustrate some of the issues surrounding the data-driven evolutionary analysis of biological systems in the context of bacterial two-component systems (TCSs). TCSs are critical for bacteria to interact with their extracellular environment. A typical TCS consists of a histidine kinase on the membrane and a response regulator in the cytoplasm. Here we comprehensively characterise the extent to which these appear together across some 950 bacterial species and test for statistically significant patterns of correlated gain and loss. Our analysis provides evidence for correlated evolution but also a high level of evolutionary flexibility: at the sequence level, histidine kinases but especially response regulators belonging to different TCSs in a species show high levels of similarity, which may facilitate crosstalk as well as the recruitment of components into new compound signalling systems. We furthermore find that bacterial lifestyle has an overriding influence on the presence and absence of TCS; while in most TCSs either both or none of the two components are present, several TCSs tend to lose preferentially either the histidine kinase or response regulator component, which further supports the notion of reuse and reshuffling of these components in different TCS arrangements. We conclude by placing these findings in a wider context and discuss the implications for evolutionary systems biology more generally.},

Nevertheless, it is not known how the observed clones may differ with respect to cell properties, such as proliferation and self-renewal. There are scarcely any data on how these cell properties change due to chemotherapy and relapse. We propose a new mathematical model to investigate the impact of cell properties on the multi-clonal composition of leukaemias. Model results imply that enhanced self-renewal may be a key mechanism in the clonal selection process. Simulations suggest that fast proliferating and highly self-renewing cells dominate at primary diagnosis, while relapse following therapy-induced remission is triggered mostly by highly self-renewing but slowly proliferating cells. Comparison of simulation results to patient data demonstrates that the proposed model is consistent with clinically observed dynamics based on a clonal selection process.},

These Lgr5(+) cells, which represent about 5 to 10\% of the cells in the adenomas, generate additional Lgr5(+) cells as well as all other adenoma cell types.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS:Growth of many different tumor types requires a population of self-renewing cancer stem cells (CSCs). c-Met is a marker of normal mouse pancreatic stem and progenitor cells; we investigated whether it is also a marker of human pancreatic CSCs that might be developed as a therapeutic target. METHODS:We studied growth of primary human pancreatic adenocarcinoma in NOD SCID mice. The self-renewal capability of pancreatic cancer cells that expressed high levels of c-Met (c-Met(high)) was assessed using in vitro sphere assays and compared with those that were c-Met negative or expressed low levels of c-Met. The tumorigenicity of c-Met(high) pancreatic cancer cells was evaluated in NOD SCID mice. RESULTS:c-Met(high) cells readily formed spheres, whereas c-Met-negative cells did not. Use of the c-Met inhibitor XL184 or c-Met knockdown with small hairpin RNAs significantly inhibited tumor sphere formation. c-Met(high) cells had increased tumorigenic potential in mice; those that expressed c-Met and CD44 (0.5\%-5\% of the pancreatic cancer cells) had the capability for self-renewal and the highest tumorigenic potential of all cell populations studied. In pancreatic tumors established in NOD SCID mice, c-Met inhibitors slowed tumor growth and reduced the population of CSCs when given alone or in combination with gemcitabine. Administration of XL184 for 2 weeks after cardiac injection of cancer cells prevented the development of metastases. CONCLUSIONS:c-Met is a new marker for pancreatic CSCs. It is required for growth and metastasis of pancreatic tumors in mice and is a therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer.},

We show that a network is injective if and only if the determinant of the Jacobian of a certain function does not vanish. The function consists of components of the species formation rate function and a maximal set of independent conservation laws. The determinant of the function is a polynomial in the species concentrations and the rate constants (linear in the latter) and its coefficients are fully determined. The criterion also precludes the existence of degenerate steady states. Further, we relate injectivity of a chemical reaction network to that of the chemical reaction network obtained by adding outflow, or degradation, reactions for all species.},

Reconstruction of gene expression dynamics from these data indicate a pivotal role for the MN determinant Olig2 just prior to MN differentiation. Olig2 represses expression of the Notch signaling pathway effectors Hes1 and Hes5. Olig2 repression of Hes5 appears to be direct, via a conserved regulatory element within the Hes5 locus that restricts expression from MN progenitors. These findings reveal a tight coupling between the regulatory networks that control patterning and neuronal differentiation, and demonstrate how Olig2 acts as the developmental pacemaker coordinating the spatial and temporal pattern of MN generation.},

	abstract = {Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are a popular approach to quantitatively model molecular networks based on biological knowledge. However, such knowledge is typically restricted. Wrongly modelled biological mechanisms as well as relevant external influence factors that are not included into the model are likely to manifest in major discrepancies between model predictions and experimental data. Finding the exact reasons for such observed discrepancies can be quite challenging in practice. In order to address this issue, we suggest a Bayesian approach to estimate hidden influences in ODE-based models. The method can distinguish between exogenous and endogenous hidden influences. Thus, we can detect wrongly specified as well as missed molecular interactions in the model. We demonstrate the performance of our Bayesian dynamic elastic-net with several ordinary differential equation models from the literature, such as human JAK-STAT signalling, information processing at the erythropoietin receptor, isomerization of liquid α-Pinene, G protein cycling in yeast and UV-B triggered signalling in plants. Moreover, we investigate a set of commonly known network motifs and a gene-regulatory network. Altogether our method supports the modeller in an algorithmic manner to identify possible sources of errors in ODE-based models on the basis of experimental data.},

This interest has grown in the recent years, because weighted volumes are widely used in implicit solvent models.

In this article, we give a formula for the volume derivative of a molecule modeled as a space-filling diagram made up of balls in motion. The formula is given in terms of the weights, radii, and distances between the centers as well as the sizes of the facets of the power diagram restricted to the space-filling diagram. Special attention is given to the detection and treatment of singularities as well as discontinuities of the derivative.},

However, drugs are tested in clinical trials on genetically diverse patient populations. We show here that patient-to-patient variability and independent drug action are sufficient to explain the superiority of many FDA-approved drug combinations in the absence of drug synergy or additivity. This is also true for combinations tested in patient-derived tumor xenografts. In a combination exhibiting independent drug action, each patient benefits solely from the drug to which his or her tumor is most sensitive, with no added benefit from other drugs. Even when drug combinations exhibit additivity or synergy in pre-clinical models, patient-to-patient variability and low cross-resistance make independent action the dominant mechanism in clinical populations. This insight represents a different way to interpret trial data and a different way to design combination therapies.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This list of genes suggests a role in host adaptation for remodeling of regulatory networks and central metabolism, acquisition of antibiotic resistance and loss of extracellular virulence factors. Furthermore, we find an ordered succession of mutations in key regulatory networks. Accordingly, mutations in downstream transcriptional regulators were contingent upon mutations in upstream regulators, suggesting that remodeling of regulatory networks might be important in adaptation. The characterization of genes involved in host adaptation may help in predicting bacterial evolution in patients with cystic fibrosis and in the design of future intervention strategies.},

	abstract = {The hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) system is a demand control system, with the demand coming from the organism, since the products of the common myeloid and lymphoid progenitor (CMP, CLP respectively) cells are essential for activity and defense against disease. We show how ideas from population biology (combining population dynamics and evolutionary considerations) can illuminate the feedback control of the HSC system by the fully differentiated products, which has recently been verified experimentally. We develop models for the penultimate differentiation of HSC Multipotent Progenitors (MPPs) into CLP and CMP and introduce two concepts from population biology into stem cell biology. The first concept is the Multipotent Progenitor Commitment Response (MPCR) which is the probability that a multipotent progenitor cell follows a CLP route rather than a CMP route. The second concept is the link between the MPCR and a measure of Darwinian fitness associated with organismal performance and the levels of differentiated lymphoid and myeloid cells. We show that many MPCRs are consistent with homeostasis, but that they will lead to different dynamics of cells and signals following a wound or injury and thus have different consequences for Darwinian fitness. We show how coupling considerations of life history to dynamics of the HSC system and its products allows one to compute the selective pressures on cellular processes. We discuss ways that this framework can be used and extended.},

A hallmark of all cancers is the capacity for unlimited self-renewal, which is also a defining characteristic of normal stem cells. Given this shared attribute, it has been proposed that leukemias may be initiated by transforming events that take place in hematopoietic stem cells. Alternatively, leukemias may also arise from more committed progenitors caused by mutations and/or selective expression of genes that enhance their otherwise limited self-renewal capabilities. Identifying the LSCs for each type of leukemia is a current challenge and a critical step in understanding their respective biologies and may provide key insights into more effective treatments. Moreover, LSC identification and purification will provide a powerful diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic tool in the clinic.},

	abstract = {Quantifying the impact of biochemical compounds on collective cell spreading is an essential element of drug design, with various applications including developing treatments for chronic wounds and cancer. Scratch assays are a technically simple and inexpensive method used to study collective cell spreading; however, most previous interpretations of scratch assays are qualitative and do not provide estimates of the cell diffusivity, D, or the cell proliferation rate, λ. Estimating D and λ is important for investigating the efficacy of a potential treatment and provides insight into the mechanism through which the potential treatment acts. While a few methods for estimating D and λ have been proposed, these previous methods lead to point estimates of D and λ, and provide no insight into the uncertainty in these estimates. Here, we compare various types of information that can be extracted from images of a scratch assay, and quantify D and λ using discrete computational simulations and approximate Bayesian computation. We show that it is possible to robustly recover estimates of D and λ from synthetic data, as well as a new set of experimental data. For the first time, our approach also provides a method to estimate the uncertainty in our estimates of D and λ. We anticipate that our approach can be generalized to deal with more realistic experimental scenarios in which we are interested in estimating D and λ, as well as additional relevant parameters such as the strength of cell-to-cell adhesion or the strength of cell-to-substrate adhesion.},

	abstract = {In addition to their self-renewal capabilities, hematopoietic stem cells guarantee the continuous supply of fully differentiated, functional cells of various types in the peripheral blood. The process which controls differentiation into the different lineages of the hematopoietic system (erythroid, myeloid, lymphoid) is referred to as lineage specification. It requires a potentially multi-step decision sequence which determines the fate of the cells and their successors. It is generally accepted that lineage specification is regulated by a complex system of interacting transcription factors. However, the underlying principles controlling this regulation are currently unknown. Here, we propose a simple quantitative model describing the interaction of two transcription factors. This model is motivated by experimental observations on the transcription factors GATA-1 and PU.1, both known to act as key regulators and potential antagonists in the erythroid vs. myeloid differentiation processes of hematopoietic progenitor cells. We demonstrate the ability of the model to account for the observed switching behavior of a transition from a state of low expression of both factors (undifferentiated state) to the dominance of one factor (differentiated state). Depending on the parameter choice, the model predicts two different possibilities to explain the experimentally suggested, stem cell characterizing priming state of low level co-expression. Whereas increasing transcription rates are sufficient to induce differentiation in one scenario, an additional system perturbation (by stochastic fluctuations or directed impulses) of transcription factor levels is required in the other case.},

Here, we investigate TAD higher-order interactions with Hi-C through neuronal differentiation and show that they form a hierarchy of domains-within-domains (metaTADs) extending across genomic scales up to the range of entire chromosomes. We find that TAD interactions are well captured by tree-like, hierarchical structures irrespective of cell type. metaTAD tree structures correlate with genetic, epigenomic and expression features, and structural tree rearrangements during differentiation are linked to transcriptional state changes. Using polymer modelling, we demonstrate that hierarchical folding promotes efficient chromatin packaging without the loss of contact specificity, highlighting a role far beyond the simple need for packing efficiency.},

	abstract = {Mating of budding yeast cells is a model system for studying cell-cell interactions. Haploid yeast cells secrete mating pheromones that are sensed by the partner which responds by growing a mating projection toward the source. The two projections meet and fuse to form the diploid. Successful mating relies on precise coordination of dynamic extracellular signals, signaling pathways, and cell shape changes in a noisy background. It remains elusive how cells mate accurately and efficiently in a natural multi-cell environment. Here we present the first stochastic model of multiple mating cells whose morphologies are driven by pheromone gradients and intracellular signals. Our novel computational framework encompassed a moving boundary method for modeling both a-cells and α-cells and their cell shape changes, the extracellular diffusion of mating pheromones dynamically coupled with cell polarization, and both external and internal noise. Quantification of mating efficiency was developed and tested for different model parameters. Computer simulations revealed important robustness strategies for mating in the presence of noise. These strategies included the polarized secretion of pheromone, the presence of the α-factor protease Bar1, and the regulation of sensing sensitivity; all were consistent with data in the literature. In addition, we investigated mating discrimination, the ability of an a-cell to distinguish between α-cells either making or not making α-factor, and mating competition, in which multiple a-cells compete to mate with one α-cell. Our simulations were consistent with previous experimental results. Moreover, we performed a combination of simulations and experiments to estimate the diffusion rate of the pheromone a-factor. In summary, we constructed a framework for simulating yeast mating with multiple cells in a noisy environment, and used this framework to reproduce mating behaviors and to identify strategies for robust cell-cell interactions.},

Using timecourse yeast gene expression data, we show how correlation of relative abundances can lead to conclusions opposite to those drawn from absolute abundances, and that its value changes when different components are included in the analysis. Once all absolute information has been removed, only a subset of those associations will reliably endure in the remaining relative data, specifically, associations where pairs of values behave proportionally across observations. We propose a new statistic ϕ to describe the strength of proportionality between two variables and demonstrate how it can be straightforwardly used instead of correlation as the basis of familiar analyses and visualization methods.},

However, paradoxically, although HSCs can be defined by function and even purified to near-homogeneity, the intricate molecular machinery and the signaling mechanisms regulating fate events, such as self-renewal and differentiation, have remained elusive. Recently, several developmentally conserved signaling pathways have emerged as important control devices of HSC fate, including Notch, Wingless-type (Wnt), Sonic hedgehog (Shh), and Smad pathways. HSCs reside in a complex environment in the bone marrow, providing a niche that optimally balances signals that control self-renewal and differentiation. These signaling circuits provide a valuable structure for our understanding of how HSC regulation occurs, concomitantly with providing information of how the bone marrow microenvironment couples and integrates extrinsic with intrinsic HSC fate determinants. It is the focus of this review to highlight some of the most recent developments concerning signaling pathways governing HSC fate.},

For example, the classic studies of Nordling [Nordling CO (1953) Br J Cancer 7(1):68-72] and Armitage and Doll [Armitage P, Doll R (1954) Br J Cancer 8(1):1-12] suggest that six or seven sequential mutations are required. Here, we describe a different approach to derive this estimate that combines conventional epidemiologic studies with genome-wide sequencing data: incidence data for different groups of patients with the same cancer type were compared with respect to their somatic mutation rates. In two well-documented cancer types (lung and colon adenocarcinomas), we find that only three sequential mutations are required to develop cancer.

	abstract = {Evolutionary dynamics have been traditionally studied in the context of homogeneous or spatially extended populations. Here we generalize population structure by arranging individuals on a graph. Each vertex represents an individual. The weighted edges denote reproductive rates which govern how often individuals place offspring into adjacent vertices. The homogeneous population, described by the Moran process, is the special case of a fully connected graph with evenly weighted edges. Spatial structures are described by graphs where vertices are connected with their nearest neighbours. We also explore evolution on random and scale-free networks. We determine the fixation probability of mutants, and characterize those graphs for which fixation behaviour is identical to that of a homogeneous population. Furthermore, some graphs act as suppressors and others as amplifiers of selection. It is even possible to find graphs that guarantee the fixation of any advantageous mutant. We also study frequency-dependent selection and show that the outcome of evolutionary games can depend entirely on the structure of the underlying graph. Evolutionary graph theory has many fascinating applications ranging from ecology to multi-cellular organization and economics.},

	abstract = {Background Spatially restricted morphogen expression drives many patterning and regeneration processes, but how is the pattern of morphogen expression established and maintained? Patterning of Drosophila leg imaginal discs requires expression of the DPP morphogen dorsally and the wingless (WG) morphogen ventrally. We have shown that these mutually exclusive patterns of expression are controlled by a self-organizing system of feedback loops that involve WG and DPP, but whether the feedback is direct or indirect is not known. Methods/Findings By analyzing expression patterns of regulatory DNA driving reporter genes in different genetic backgrounds, we identify a key component of this system by showing that WG directly represses transcription of the dpp gene in the ventral leg disc. Repression of dpp requires a tri-partite complex of the WG mediators armadillo (ARM) and dTCF, and the co-repressor Brinker, (BRK), wherein ARM•dTCF and BRK bind to independent sites within the dpp locus. Conclusions/Significance Many examples of dTCF repression in the absence of WNT signaling have been described, but few examples of signal-driven repression requiring both ARM and dTCF binding have been reported. Thus, our findings represent a new mode of WG mediated repression and demonstrate that direct regulation between morphogen signaling pathways can contribute to a robust self-organizing system capable of dynamically maintaining territories of morphogen expression.},

	abstract = {Cancer dynamics are an evolutionary game between cellular phenotypes. A typical assumption in this modelling paradigm is that the probability of a given phenotypic strategy interacting with another depends exclusively on the abundance of those strategies without regard for local neighbourhood structure. We address this limitation by using the Ohtsuki–Nowak transform to introduce spatial structure to the go versus grow game. We show that spatial structure can promote the invasive (go) strategy. By considering the change in neighbourhood size at a static boundary—such as a blood vessel, organ capsule or basement membrane—we show an edge effect that allows a tumour without invasive phenotypes in the bulk to have a polyclonal boundary with invasive cells. We present an example of this promotion of invasive (epithelial–mesenchymal transition-positive) cells in a metastatic colony of prostate adenocarcinoma in bone marrow. Our results caution that pathologic analyses that do not distinguish between cells in the bulk and cells at a static edge of a tumour can underestimate the number of invasive cells. Although we concentrate on applications in mathematical oncology, we expect our approach to extend to other evolutionary game models where interaction neighbourhoods change at fixed system boundaries.},

We demonstrated in vivo as well as ex vivo genome editing using adeno-associated virus (AAV)-, lentivirus-, or particle-mediated delivery of guide RNA in neurons, immune cells, and endothelial cells. Using these mice, we simultaneously modeled the dynamics of \textit{KRAS}, \textit{p53}, and \textit{LKB1}, the top three significantly mutated genes in lung adenocarcinoma. Delivery of a single AAV vector in the lung generated loss-of-function mutations in \textit{p53} and \textit{Lkb1}, as well as homology-directed repair-mediated \textit{Kras}$^{\textrm{G12D}}$ mutations, leading to macroscopic tumors of adenocarcinoma pathology.

This model provides a powerful method for fitting and analyzing fluorescent division tracking data and reveals how summing receptor-mediated kinetic changes can modify the immune response progressively from rapid tolerance induction to strong immunity. An important consequence of our results is that intrinsic variability in otherwise identical cells, usually dismissed as noise, may have evolved to be an essential feature of immune regulation.},

	abstract = {The integration of processes at different scales is a key problem in the modelling of cell populations. Owing to increased computational resources and the accumulation of data at the cellular and subcellular scales, the use of discrete, cell-level models, which are typically solved using numerical simulations, has become prominent. One of the merits of this approach is that important biological factors, such as cell heterogeneity and noise, can be easily incorporated. However, it can be difficult to efficiently draw generalizations from the simulation results, as, often, many simulation runs are required to investigate model behaviour in typically large parameter spaces. In some cases, discrete cell-level models can be coarse-grained, yielding continuum models whose analysis can lead to the development of insight into the underlying simulations. In this paper we apply such an approach to the case of a discrete model of cell dynamics in the intestinal crypt. An analysis of the resulting continuum model demonstrates that there is a limited region of parameter space within which steady-state (and hence biologically realistic) solutions exist. Continuum model predictions show good agreement with corresponding results from the underlying simulations and experimental data taken from murine intestinal crypts.},

Progenitor cells of the haematopoietic system, such as common myeloid progenitors and common lymphoid progeni- tors, increase the production of immune cells to restore and main- tain homeostasis during chronic infection, but the contribution of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to this process is largely unknown2. Here we show, using an in vivo mouse model of Mycobacterium avium infection, that an increased proportion of long-term repopulating HSCs proliferate during M. avium infec- tion, and that this response requires interferon-c (IFN-c) but not interferon-a (IFN-a) signalling. Thus, the haematopoietic res- ponse to chronic bacterial infection involves the activation not only of intermediate blood progenitors but of long-term repopu- lating HSCs as well. IFN-c is sufficient to promote long-term repopulating HSC proliferation in vivo; furthermore, HSCs from IFN-c-deficient mice have a lower proliferative rate, indicating that baseline IFN-c tone regulates HSC activity. These findings implicate IFN-c both as a regulator of HSCs during homeostasis and under conditions of infectious stress. Our studies contribute to a deeper understanding of haematological responses in patients with chronic infections such as HIV/AIDS or tuberculosis3–5.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The development of metastatic cancer is a multistage process, which often requires decades to complete. Impairments in DNA damage control and DNA repair in cancer cell precursors generate genetically heterogeneous cell populations. However, despite heterogeneity most solid cancers have stereotypical behaviours, including invasiveness and suppression of immune responses that can be unleashed with immunotherapy targeting lymphocyte checkpoints. The mechanisms leading to the acquisition of stereotypical properties remain poorly understood. Reactivation of embryonic development processes in cells with unstable genomes might contribute to tumour expansion and metastasis formation. However, it is unclear whether these events are linked to immune response modulation. Tumours and embryos have non-self-components and need to avoid immune responses in their microenvironment. In mammalian embryos, neo-antigens are of paternal origin, while in tumour cells DNA mismatch repair and replication defects generate them. Inactivation of the maternal immune response towards the embryo, which occurs at the placental–maternal interface, is key to ensuring embryonic development. This regulation is accomplished by the trophoblast, which mimics several malignant cell features, including the ability to invade normal tissues and to avoid host immune responses, often adopting the same cancer immunoediting strategies. A better understanding as to whether and how genotoxic stress promotes cancer development through reactivation of programmes occurring during early stages of mammalian placentation could help to clarify resistance to drugs targeting immune checkpoint and DNA damage responses and to develop new therapeutic strategies to eradicate cancer.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The spatially confined fate specification establishes a distinct distribution of cells in each germlayer during early gastrulation.

	abstract = {Aging is associated with the functional decline of cells, tissues, and organs. At the same time, age is the single most important prognostic factor in the development of most human cancers, including chronic myelogenous and acute lymphoblastic leukemias initiated by Bcr-Abl oncogenic translocations. Prevailing paradigms attribute the association between aging and cancers to the accumulation of oncogenic mutations over time, because the accrual of oncogenic events is thought to be the rate-limiting step in initiation and progression of cancers. Conversely, aging-associated functional decline caused by both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms is likely to reduce the fitness of stem and progenitor cell populations. This reduction in fitness should be conducive for increased selection of oncogenic mutations that can at least partially alleviate fitness defects, thereby promoting the initiation of cancers. We tested this hypothesis using mouse hematopoietic models. Our studies indicate that the dramatic decline in the fitness of aged B-lymphopoiesis coincides with altered receptor-associated kinase signaling. We further show that Bcr-Abl provides a much greater competitive advantage to old B-lymphoid progenitors compared with young progenitors, coinciding with restored kinase signaling pathways, and that this enhanced competitive advantage translates into increased promotion of Bcr-Abl-driven leukemias. Moreover, impairing IL-7-mediated signaling is sufficient to promote selection for Bcr-Abl-expressing B progenitors. These studies support an unappreciated causative link between aging and cancer: increased selection of oncogenic mutations as a result of age-dependent alterations of the fitness landscape.},

	volume = {109},
	url = {https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2478566},
	abstract = {Keratins K14 and K5 have long been considered to be biochemical markers of the stratified squamous epithelia, including epidermis (Moll, R., W. Franke, D. Schiller, B. Geiger, and R. Krepler. 1982. Cell. 31:11-24; Nelson, W., and T.-T. Sun. 1983. J. Cell Biol. 97:244-251). When cells of most stratified squamous epithelia differentiate, they downregulate expression of mRNAs encoding these two keratins and induce expression of new sets of keratins specific for individual programs of epithelial differentiation. Frequently, as in the case of epidermis, the expression of differentiation-specific keratins also leads to a reorganization of the keratin filament network, including denser bundling of the keratin fibers. We report here the use of monospecific antisera and cRNA probes to examine the differential expression of keratin K14 in the complex tissue of human skin. Using in situ hybridizations and immunoelectron microscopy, we find that the patterns of K14 expression and filament organization in the hair follicle are strikingly different from epidermis. Some of the mitotically active outer root sheath (ORS) cells, which give rise to ORS under normal circumstances and to epidermis during wound healing, produce only low levels of K14. These cells have fewer keratin filaments than basal epidermal cells, and the filaments are organized into looser, more delicate bundles than is typical for epidermis. As these cells differentiate, they elevate their expression of K14 and produce denser bundles of keratin filaments more typical of epidermis. In contrast to basal cells of epidermis and ORS, matrix cells, which are relatively undifferentiated and which can give rise to inner root sheath, cuticle and hair shaft, show no evidence of K14, K14 mRNA expression, or keratin filament formation. As matrix cells differentiate, they produce hair-specific keratins and dense bundles of keratin filaments but they do not induce K14 expression. Collectively, the patterns of K14 and K14 mRNA expression and filament organization in mitotically active epithelial cells of the skin correlate with their relative degree of pluripotency, and this suggests a possible basis for the deviation of hair follicle programs of differentiation from those of other stratified squamous epithelia.},

	abstract = {Cellular signal transduction usually involves activation cascades, the sequential activation of a series of proteins following the reception of an input signal. Here, we study the classic model of weakly activated cascades and obtain analytical solutions for a variety of inputs. We show that in the special but important case of optimal gain cascades (i.e. when the deactivation rates are identical) the downstream output of the cascade can be represented exactly as a lumped nonlinear module containing an incomplete gamma function with real parameters that depend on the rates and length of the cascade, as well as parameters of the input signal. The expressions obtained can be applied to the non-identical case when the deactivation rates are random to capture the variability in the cascade outputs. We also show that cascades can be rearranged so that blocks with similar rates can be lumped and represented through our nonlinear modules. Our results can be used both to represent cascades in computational models of differential equations and to fit data efficiently, by reducing the number of equations and parameters involved. In particular, the length of the cascade appears as a real-valued parameter and can thus be fitted in the same manner as Hill coefficients. Finally, we show how the obtained nonlinear modules can be used instead of delay differential equations to model delays in signal transduction.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Regulation of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an emerging theme in acute leukemia biology (1, 2). EMT is required for many aspects of development, including gastrulation and mesoderm formation. It has also been associated with malignant processes such as epithelial tumor cell invasion and metastasis, and the development, function and chemo-resistance of cancer stem cells. Master regulators of EMT belong to the Snail (Snai1/Snai2/Snai3) and Zeb (Zeb1/Zeb2) families of transcription factors. While they have primarily been studied in relation to solid organ development and embryogenesis, recent work has begun to uncover novel roles for these proteins in both normal and malignant hematopoiesis. A mounting body of evidence implicates the founding member of the Snail family, SNAI1, in Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) development. Transgenic Snai1 expression induces myeloid leukaemia in mice (3), and human AML cells show increased SNAI1 expression compared to haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). We have also found that shRNA knockdown of SNAI1 in AML cells induces differentiation, as measured by increased CD11b expression. In this paper we elucidate the mechanisms by which elevated levels of Snai1 impair normal hematopoiesis and promote leukemogenesis. Results: We employed murine retroviral and transgenic models to drive high levels of Snai1 in hematopoietic cells in vivo. Homozygous expression of a Snai1 transgene, using the endothelial and hematopoietic restricted Tie2-Cre, resulted in embryonic lethality at E15.5-17.5. Embryos were highly anemic, exhibiting normal primitive erythropoiesis, but severely impaired definitive erythropoiesis. Retroviral mediated overexpression of Snai1 during adult hematopoiesis resulted in a significant expansion of the Granulocyte-Macrophage progenitor (GMP) compartment, with a concomitant reduction in Megakaryocyte-Erythroid progenitor (MEP) numbers. Downstream myeloid development was also perturbed, with a strong differentiation bias towards macrophage production, at the expense of granulocyte development. Mice (n=4) have also begun to develop an aggressive AML beginning at 12 months of age, consistent with the previously published transgenic model (3). The effects of Snai1 expression on myeloid development are reminiscent of those observed in mice lacking Gfi1 or Gfi1b, suggesting possible competition for, or altered function of, their common co-repressor: the chromatin modulator Lsd1. To test this hypothesis, we generated a mutant form of Snai1 that does not bind Lsd1 and retrovirally expressed it in HSPCs. Unlike wild-type Snai1, the mutant form was unable to induce hematopoietic defects or AML development in mice. We next conducted gene expression profiling on the HPC7 hematopoietic progenitor cell line, with or without ectopic Snai1 expression. We observed a significant up-regulation of GMP-associated genes and more mature monocyte/macrophage related genes. These data, along with morphological analysis, suggested that Snai1 expressing HPC7 cells take on a macrophage-biased GMP-like phenotype, but do not fully differentiate into mature myeloid cells. Moreover, there was a significant correlation to gene expression programs from Gfi1/1b knockout HSCs, further implicating loss of Gfi1/1b activity in driving these myeloid phenotypes. Strikingly, we also observed evidence of inflammatory cytokine production and activation of key downstream signaling pathways that contribute to AML cell survival and proliferation. Whether this effect is due to altered regulation of Lsd1 targets, or instead represents a distinct Lsd1-independent mechanism, remains to be determined. Conclusion: We have shown that Snai1 expression perturbs myeloid cell development and induces AML in an Lsd1-dependent manner. Snai1 expression likely contributes to increased survival and proliferation of leukemic cells via induction of key inflammatory signaling pathways that support tumor cell growth. These data confirm the importance of Snai1 in AML development and pathogenesis. References: 1. Goossens S, et al. (2015).Nature communications 6:5794. 2. Stavropoulou V, et al. (2016).

To understand how signaling networks process dynamic inputs into gene expression outputs and the role of noise in cellular information processing, we studied the immune pathway NF-κB under periodic cytokine inputs using microfluidic single-cell measurements and stochastic modeling. We find that NF-κB dynamics in fibroblasts synchronize with oscillating TNF signal and become entrained, leading to significantly increased NF-κB oscillation amplitude and mRNA output compared to non-entrained response. Simulations show that intrinsic biochemical noise in individual cells improves NF-κB oscillation and entrainment, whereas cell-to-cell variability in NF-κB natural frequency creates population robustness, together enabling entrainment over a wider range of dynamic inputs. This wide range is confirmed by experiments where entrained cells were measured under all input periods. These results indicate that synergy between oscillation and noise allows cells to achieve efficient gene expression in dynamically changing signaling environments.},

Model rejection can then be performed by assessing the degree to which the transformed data deviate from coplanarity. We demonstrate our method by applying it to models of multisite phosphorylation and cell death signaling. Our framework offers a parameter-free perspective on the statistical model selection problem, which can complement conventional statistical methods in certain classes of problems where inference has to be based on steady-state data and the model structures allow for suitable algebraic relationships among the steady-state solutions.},

In fact, the likelihood of the data under complex stochastic models is often analytically or numerically intractable in many areas of sciences. This makes it even more important to simultaneously investigate the adequacy of these models-in absolute terms, against the data, rather than relative to the performance of other models-but no such procedure has been formally discussed when the likelihood is intractable. We provide a statistical interpretation to current developments in likelihood-free Bayesian inference that explicitly accounts for discrepancies between the model and the data, termed Approximate Bayesian Computation under model uncertainty (ABCmicro). We augment the likelihood of the data with unknown error terms that correspond to freely chosen checking functions, and provide Monte Carlo strategies for sampling from the associated joint posterior distribution without the need of evaluating the likelihood. We discuss the benefit of incorporating model diagnostics within an ABC framework, and demonstrate how this method diagnoses model mismatch and guides model refinement by contrasting three qualitative models of protein network evolution to the protein interaction datasets of Helicobacter pylori and Treponema pallidum. Our results make a number of model deficiencies explicit, and suggest that the T. pallidum network topology is inconsistent with evolution dominated by link turnover or lateral gene transfer alone.},

	abstract = {Many natural processes consist of networks of interacting elements that, over time, affect each other's state. Their dynamics depend on the pattern of connections and the updating rules for each element. Genomic regulatory networks are networks of this sort. In this paper we use artificial neural networks as a model of the dynamics of gene expression. The significance of the regulatory effect of one gene product on the expression of other genes of the system is defined by a weight matrix. The model considers multigenic regulation including positive and/or negative feedback. The process of gene expression is described by a single network and by two linked networks where transcription and translation are modeled independently. Each of these processes is described by different network controlled by different weight matrices. Methods for computing the parameters of the model from experimental data are discussed. Results computed by means of the model are compared with experimental observations. Generalization to a 'black box' concept, where the molecular processes occurring in the cell are considered as signal processing units forming a global regulatory network, is discussed.-Vohradský, J.

Although much is known about the underlying signaling pathways, it remains unclear how macroscopic features of branched organs, including their size, network topology, and spatial patterning, are encoded. Here, we show that, in mouse mammary gland, kidney, and human prostate, these features can be explained quantitatively within a single unifying framework of branching and annihilating random walks. Based on quantitative analyses of large-scale organ reconstructions and proliferation kinetics measurements, we propose that morphogenesis follows from the proliferative activity of equipotent tips that stochastically branch and randomly explore their environment but compete neutrally for space, becoming proliferatively inactive when in proximity with neighboring ducts. These results show that complex branched epithelial structures develop as a self-organized process, reliant upon a strikingly simple but generic rule, without recourse to a rigid and deterministic sequence of genetically programmed events.},

	abstract = {In 1952, Alan Turing proposed that biological morphogenesis could arise from a dynamical process in reaction systems with a rapidly diffusing inhibitor and a slowly diffusing activator. Turing’s conditions are disappointingly hard to achieve in nature, but recent stochastic extension of the theory predicts pattern formation without such strong conditions. We have forward-engineered bacterial populations with signaling molecules that form a stochastic activator–inhibitor system that does not satisfy the classic Turing conditions but exhibits disordered patterns with a defined length scale and spatial correlations that agree quantitatively with stochastic Turing theory. Our results suggest that Turing-type mechanisms, driven by gene expression or other source of stochasticity, may underlie a much broader range of patterns in nature than currently thought. The origin of biological morphology and form is one of the deepest problems in science, underlying our understanding of development and the functioning of living systems. In 1952, Alan Turing showed that chemical morphogenesis could arise from a linear instability of a spatially uniform state, giving rise to periodic pattern formation in reaction–diffusion systems but only those with a rapidly diffusing inhibitor and a slowly diffusing activator. These conditions are disappointingly hard to achieve in nature, and the role of Turing instabilities in biological pattern formation has been called into question. Recently, the theory was extended to include noisy activator–inhibitor birth and death processes. Surprisingly, this stochastic Turing theory predicts the existence of patterns over a wide range of parameters, in particular with no severe requirement on the ratio of activator–inhibitor diffusion coefficients. To explore whether this mechanism is viable in practice, we have genetically engineered a synthetic bacterial population in which the signaling molecules form a stochastic activator–inhibitor system. The synthetic pattern-forming gene circuit destabilizes an initially homogenous lawn of genetically engineered bacteria, producing disordered patterns with tunable features on a spatial scale much larger than that of a single cell. Spatial correlations of the experimental patterns agree quantitatively with the signature predicted by theory. These results show that Turing-type pattern-forming mechanisms, if driven by stochasticity, can potentially underlie a broad range of biological patterns. These findings provide the groundwork for a unified picture of biological morphogenesis, arising from a combination of stochastic gene expression and dynamical instabilities.},

	abstract = {Hematopoiesis is often pictured as a hierarchy of branching decisions, giving rise to all mature blood cell types from stepwise differentiation of a single cell, the hematopoietic stem cell. Various aspects of this process have been modeled using various experimental and theoretical techniques on different scales. Here we integrate the more common population-based approach with a single-cell resolved molecular differentiation model to study the possibility of inferring mechanistic knowledge of the differentiation process. We focus on a sub-module of hematopoiesis: differentiation of granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs) to granulocytes or monocytes. Within a branching process model, we infer the differentiation probability of GMPs from the experimentally quantified heterogeneity of colony assays under permissive conditions where both granulocytes and monocytes can emerge. We compare the predictions with the differentiation probability in genealogies determined from single-cell time-lapse microscopy. In contrast to the branching process model, we found that the differentiation probability as determined by differentiation marker onset increases with the generation of the cell within the genealogy. To study this feature from a molecular perspective, we established a stochastic toggle switch model, in which the intrinsic lineage decision is executed using two antagonistic transcription factors. We identified parameter regimes that allow for both time-dependent and time-independent differentiation probabilities. Finally, we infer parameters for which the model matches experimentally observed differentiation probabilities via approximate Bayesian computing. These parameters suggest different timescales in the dynamics of granulocyte and monocyte differentiation. Thus we provide a multi-scale picture of cell differentiation in murine GMPs, and illustrate the need for single-cell time-resolved observations of cellular decisions.},

Exogenous PU.1 expression in progenitors increases endogenous PU.1 levels by inducing cell cycle lengthening, implying positive feedback between a regulatory factor and the cell cycle. Mathematical modeling showed that this cell cycle-coupled feedback architecture effectively stabilizes a slow-dividing differentiated state.

We have characterized the transcriptional transactivation properties of Enl, a protein that is fused to Hrx in t(11;19) leukemias. Enl is a nuclear protein that is capable of activating transcription from synthetic reporter genes in both lymphoid and myeloid cells, as well as in yeast. Deletion mutagenesis demonstrated that the minimal portion of Enl required for activation of transcription was localized to its C-terminal 90 amino acids. This region is highly conserved between Enl and the t(9;11) fusion partner Af-9 and is retained in all Hrx-Enl and Hrx-Af9 fusion proteins. Thus, the leukemogenic contribution and transcriptional activation potential of Enl colocalize to its highly conserved carboxy terminus, suggesting that Hrx-Enl chimeric proteins mediate alterations in the transcription program of t(11;19)-bearing cells.},

	abstract = {Author summary One hallmark of cancer is angiogenesis, the formation of new blood capillaries from pre-existing vessels. Angiogenesis promotes tumor growth by enabling the tumor to obtain oxygen and nutrients from the surrounding microenvironment. Cancer drugs that inhibit angiogenesis ("anti-angiogenic therapies") have focused on inhibiting proteins that promote the growth of new blood vessels. The response to anti-angiogenic therapy is highly variable, and some tumors do not respond at all. Therefore, identifying a biomarker that predicts how specific tumors will respond would be extremely valuable. This work uses a computational model of tumor-bearing mice to investigate the response to anti-angiogenic treatment that targets the potent promoter of angiogenesis, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and how the response is influenced by tumor growth kinetics. We show that certain properties of tumor growth can be used to predict how much the tumor volume will be reduced upon administration of an anti-VEGF drug. This work identifies tumor growth parameters that may be reliable biomarkers for predicting how tumors will respond to anti-VEGF therapy. Our computational model generates novel, testable hypotheses and nicely complements pre-clinical studies of anti-angiogenic therapeutics.},

To exhaustively enumerate topologies that exhibit this switch-like behavior, we simulated all possible two- and three-component networks on random parameter sets, and assessed the resulting response profiles for both steepness (ultrasensitivity) and extent of memory (bistability). Simulations were used to study purely enzymatic networks, purely transcriptional networks, and hybrid enzymatic/transcriptional networks, and the topologies in each class were rank ordered by parametric robustness (i.e., the percentage of applied parameter sets exhibiting ultrasensitivity or bistability). Results reveal that the distribution of network robustness is highly skewed, with the most robust topologies clustering into a small number of motifs. Hybrid networks are the most robust in generating ultrasensitivity (up to 28\%) and bistability (up to 18\%); strikingly, a purely transcriptional framework is the most fragile in generating either ultrasensitive (up to 3\%) or bistable (up to 1\%) responses. The disparity in robustness among the network classes is due in part to zero-order ultrasensitivity, an enzyme-specific phenomenon, which repeatedly emerges as a particularly robust mechanism for generating nonlinearity and can act as a building block for switch-like responses. We also highlight experimentally studied examples of topologies enabling switching behavior, in both native and synthetic systems, that rank highly in our simulations. This unbiased approach for identifying topologies capable of a given response may be useful in discovering new natural motifs and in designing robust synthetic gene networks.},

We present a draft tree containing 2.3 million tips-the Open Tree of Life. Realization of this tree required the assembly of two additional community resources: (i) a comprehensive global reference taxonomy and (ii) a database of published phylogenetic trees mapped to this taxonomy. Our open source framework facilitates community comment and contribution, enabling the tree to be continuously updated when new phylogenetic and taxonomic data become digitally available. Although data coverage and phylogenetic conflict across the Open Tree of Life illuminate gaps in both the underlying data available for phylogenetic reconstruction and the publication of trees as digital objects, the tree provides a compelling starting point for community contribution. This comprehensive tree will fuel fundamental research on the nature of biological diversity, ultimately providing up-to-date phylogenies for downstream applications in comparative biology, ecology, conservation biology, climate change, agriculture, and genomics.},

We do so by proposing multiple points in parallel, then constructing and sampling from a finite-state Markov chain on the proposed points such that the overall procedure has the correct target density as its stationary distribution. Our approach is generally applicable and straightforward to implement. We demonstrate how this construction may be used to greatly increase the computational speed and statistical efficiency of a variety of existing MCMC methods, including Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithms and Adaptive MCMC. Furthermore, we show how it allows for a principled way of using every integration step within Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods; our approach increases robustness to the choice of algorithmic parameters and results in increased accuracy of Monte Carlo estimates with little extra computational cost.},

We trace the roots of this heterogeneity to micro-niches along epithelial-mesenchymal interfaces, where progenitors display molecular signatures reflective of spatially distinct local signals and intercellular interactions. Using lineage tracing, temporal single-cell analyses, and chromatin landscaping, we show that SC plasticity becomes restricted in a sequentially and spatially choreographed program, culminating in seven spatially arranged unilineage progenitors within TACs of mature follicles. By compartmentalizing SCs into micro-niches, tissues gain precise control over morphogenesis and regeneration: some progenitors specify lineages immediately, whereas others retain potency, preserving self-renewing features established early while progressively restricting lineages as they experience dynamic changes in microenvironment.},

	abstract = {Canonical Wnt signaling requires inhibition of Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 (GSK3) activity, but the molecular mechanism by which this is achieved remains unclear. Here, we report that Wnt signaling triggers the sequestration of GSK3 from the cytosol into multivesicular bodies (MVBs), so that this enzyme becomes separated from its many cytosolic substrates. Endocytosed Wnt colocalized with GSK3 in acidic vesicles positive for endosomal markers. After Wnt addition, endogenous GSK3 activity decreased in the cytosol, and GSK3 became protected from protease treatment inside membrane-bounded organelles. Cryoimmunoelectron microscopy showed that these corresponded to MVBs. Two proteins essential for MVB formation, HRS/Vps27 and Vps4, were required for Wnt signaling. The sequestration of GSK3 extended the half-life of many other proteins in addition to $\beta$-Catenin, including an artificial Wnt-regulated reporter protein containing GSK3 phosphorylation sites. We conclude that multivesicular endosomes are essential components of the Wnt signal-transduction pathway.},

The methodology we apply uses a distance defined in terms of graph spectra which captures the network data more naturally than previously used summary statistics such as the degree distribution. Furthermore, we include the effects of sampling into the analysis, to properly correct for the incompleteness of existing datasets, and have analysed the performance of our method under various degrees of sampling. We consider a number of models focusing not only on the biologically relevant class of duplication models, but also including models of scale-free network growth that have previously been claimed to describe such data. We find a preference for a duplication-divergence with linear preferential attachment model in the majority of the interaction datasets considered. We also illustrate how our method can be used to perform multi-model inference of network parameters to estimate properties of the full network from sampled data.},

	abstract = {Many epithelial tissues within large multicellular organisms are continually replenished by small independent populations of stem cells. These stem cells divide within their niches and differentiate into the constituent cell types of the tissue, and are largely responsible for maintaining tissue homeostasis. Mutations can accumulate in stem cell niches and change the rate of stem cell division and differentiation, contributing to both aging and tumorigenesis. Here, we create a mathematical model of the intestinal stem cell niche, crypt system, and epithelium. We calculate the expected effect of fixed mutations in stem cell niches and their expected effect on tissue homeostasis throughout the intestinal epithelium over the lifetime of an organism. We find that, due to the small population size of stem cell niches, fixed mutations are expected to accumulate via genetic drift and decrease stem cell fitness, leading to niche and tissue attrition, and contributing to organismal aging. We also explore mutation accumulation at various stem cell niche sizes, and demonstrate that an evolutionary trade-off exists between niche size, tissue aging, and the risk of tumorigenesis; where niches exist at a size that minimizes the probability of tumorigenesis, at the expense of accumulating deleterious mutations due to genetic drift. Finally, we show that the probability of tumorigenesis and the extent of aging trade-off differently depending on whether mutational effects confer a selective advantage, or not, in the stem cell niche.},

The animals were the female offspring of Geoffroy male and domestic female cats. In repeated studies of marrow from control animals (n = 5) or experimental animals prior to transplantation (n = 3), the percent of progenitors with domestic-type G6PD did not vary. After transplantation, the peripheral blood counts, marrow morphologies, frequencies of progenitors, and progenitor cell cycle kinetics returned to normal. However, abrupt and significant fluctuations were seen in the G6PD type of progenitors from each cat during the 1-1.5 years of observation. These data cannot be explained if there were either a large or constant population of active stem cells and thus imply, in a large-animal system, that hematopoiesis was maintained through clonal succession.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}During embryonic development, cells undertake a series of cell fate decisions to form a complete organism, epitomising a branching process; in some instances, these decisions may be reversible, particularly during the onset of disease, exemplifying a recombination process. Single cell transcriptomics provide a rich resource to explore the temporal progression of bifurcations in gene activity, and thus elucidate mechanisms of cell fate decisions. However, identification of transcriptional branching or recombination poses a major statistical challenge. Here, we have developed a comprehensive nonparametric Bayesian approach to the inference of branching and recombination, in the form of branch-recombinant Gaussian Processes (B-RGPs). We use B-RGPs to infer transcriptional branching that occurs during early human development as primordial germ cells (PGCs), the precursors of sperm and egg, are specified in the developing embryo. Using our approach, we identify known master regulators of human PGC development, and predict roles for a variety of signalling pathways and genetic regulators. By concentrating on the earliest signalling events, we identified an antagonistic role for FGF receptor (FGFR) signalling pathway in the acquisition of competence for human PGC fate. Indeed, the experimental validation of our prediction confirmed that pharmacological blocking of FGFR or its downstream effectors (MEK, PI3K and JAK) enhanced the competency for PGC fate in vitro. Thus, B-RGPs represent a powerful and flexible data driven approach for dissecting the temporal dynamics of cell fate decisions, providing unique insights into the mechanisms of early embryogenesis.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

RESULTS:We introduce Slingshot, a novel method for inferring cell lineages and pseudotimes from single-cell gene expression data. In previously published datasets, Slingshot correctly identifies the biological signal for one to three branching trajectories. Additionally, our simulation study shows that Slingshot infers more accurate pseudotimes than other leading methods. CONCLUSIONS:Slingshot is a uniquely robust and flexible tool which combines the highly stable techniques necessary for noisy single-cell data with the ability to identify multiple trajectories.

Although overlapping molecules and pathways have been reported to regulate the stem-like phenotype of CSCs and metastasis, accumulated evidence has suggested additional clonal diversity within the stem-like cancer cell subpopulation.

During development, cells translate extracellular bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) gradients, often subject to noise, into graded intracellular tail-phosphorylated SMAD (TP-SMAD) levels. Using modelling and experimental approaches, we found that BMPs induce TP-SMAD responses in neural precursor cells in a concentration-dependent manner, which are semi-adaptive within a specific intermediate range of BMP concentration. These semi-adaptive TP-SMAD responses involve an intrinsically slow deactivation of BMP receptors, which attenuates noise by prolonging SMAD deactivation time after BMP withdrawal, but increases response time. Interestingly, negative feedback on BMP receptors is also required for semi-adaptation, which benefits both noise attenuation and response time, and therefore balances the trade-off seen with slow BMP receptor deactivation. These results highlight the rich dynamics of SMAD regulation in response to graded BMP concentration, and elucidate general design principles for balancing noise attenuation and activation speed in signalling systems.},

Since incorrect models lead to incorrect predictions, it is vital to have as accurate a model as possible. As a result, new techniques and models for analyzing and modeling real-world networks have recently been introduced. RESULTS:One example of large and complex networks involves protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. We analyze PPI networks of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster using a newly introduced measure of local network structure as well as the standardly used measures of global network structure. We examine the fit of four different network models, including Erdos-Renyi, scale-free and geometric random network models, to these PPI networks with respect to the measures of local and global network structure. We demonstrate that the currently accepted scale-free model of PPI networks fails to fit the data in several respects and show that a random geometric model provides a much more accurate model of the PPI data. We hypothesize that only the noise in these networks is scale-free. Conclusions: We systematically evaluate how well-different network models fit the PPI networks. We show that the structure of PPI networks is better modeled by a geometric random graph than by a scale-free model.

Mathematical modeling identified gene-specific on- and off-switching rates in transcriptional activity and mean numbers of mRNAs produced during the bursts.

Our analysis demonstrated that bursting kinetics are highly gene-specific, reflecting refractory periods during which genes stay inactive for a certain time before switching on again.},

	abstract = {A significant fraction of mice deficient in either glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) or its co-receptors (Gfrα1, Ret), undergoes ureteric bud (UB) outgrowth leading to the formation of a rudimentary kidney. Previous studies using the isolated Wolffian duct (WD) culture indicate that activation of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor signaling, together with suppression of BMP/Activin signaling, is critical for GDNF-independent WD budding (Maeshima et al., 2007). By expression analysis of embryonic kidney from Ret((-/-)) mice, we found the upregulation of several FGFs, including FGF7. To examine the intracellular pathways, we then analyzed GDNF-dependent and GDNF-independent budding in the isolated WD culture. In both conditions, Akt activation was found to be important; however, whereas this occurred through PI3-kinase in GDNF-dependent budding, in the case of GDNF-independent budding, Akt activation was apparently via a PI3-kinase independent mechanism. Jnk signaling and the AP-1 transcription factor complex were also implicated in GDNF-independent budding. FosB, a binding partner of c-Jun in the formation of AP-1, was the most highly upregulated gene in the ret knockout kidney (in which budding had still occurred), and we found that its siRNA-mediated knockdown in isolated WDs also blocked GDNF-independent budding. Taken together with the finding that inhibition of Jnk signaling does not block Akt activation/phosphorylation in GDNF-independent budding, the data support necessary roles for both FosB/Jun/AP-1 signaling and PI3-kinase-independent activation of Akt in GDNF-independent budding. A model is proposed for signaling events that involve Akt and JNK working to regulate GDNF-independent WD budding.},

	abstract = {The Wnt signaling pathway transducing the stabilization of $\beta$ -catenin is essential for metazoan embryo development and is misregulated in many diseases such as cancers. In recent years models have been proposed for the Wnt signaling pathway during the segmentation process in developing embryos. Many of these include negative feedback loops where Axin2 plays a key role. However, Axin2 null mice show no segmentation phenotype. We therefore propose a new model where the negative feedback involves Dkk1 rather than Axin2. We show that this model can exhibit the same type of oscillations as the previous models with Axin2 and as observed in experiments. We show that a spatial Wnt gradient can consistently convert this temporal periodicity into the spatial periodicity of somites, provided the oscillations in new cells arising in the presomitic mesoderm are synchronized with the oscillations of older cells. We further investigate the hypothesis that a change in the Wnt level in the tail bud during the later stages of somitogenesis can lengthen the time period of the oscillations and hence the size and separation of the later somites.},

These studies, however, have emphasized only a few types of stability, and they rarely uncover the mechanisms responsible for stability. Because anthropogenic changes often affect stability and diversity simultaneously, diversity-stability relationships cannot be understood outside the context of the environmental drivers affecting both.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The classic view of metastatic cancer progression is that it is a unidirectional process initiated at the primary tumor site, progressing to variably distant metastatic sites in a fairly predictable, although not perfectly understood, fashion. A Markov chain Monte Carlo mathematical approach can determine a pathway diagram that classifies metastatic tumors as “spreaders” or “sponges” and orders the timescales of progression from site to site. In light of recent experimental evidence highlighting the potential significance of self-seeding of primary tumors, we use a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, based on large autopsy data sets, to quantify the stochastic, systemic, and often multidirectional aspects of cancer progression. We quantify three types of multidirectional mechanisms of progression: (i) self-seeding of the primary tumor, (ii) reseeding of the primary tumor from a metastatic site (primary reseeding), and (iii) reseeding of metastatic tumors (metastasis reseeding). The model shows that the combined characteristics of the primary and the first metastatic site to which it spreads largely determine the future pathways and timescales of systemic disease. \textit{Cancer Res; 73(9); 2760–9. ©2013 AACR}.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here we address molecular mechanisms of macrophage production in a conditional mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma. We report that overproduction of the peptide hormone Angiotensin II (AngII) in tumor- bearing mice amplifies self-renewing hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and macrophage progenitors. The process occurred in the spleen but not the bone marrow, and was independent of hemodynamic changes. The effects of AngII required direct hormone ligation on HSCs, depended on S1P1 signaling, and allowed the extramedullary tissue to supply new tumor-associated macrophages throughout cancer progression. Conversely, blocking AngII production prevented cancer-induced HSC and macrophage progenitor amplification and thus restrained the macrophage response at its source. These findings indicate that AngII acts upstream of a potent macrophage amplification program and that tumors can remotely exploit the hormone’s pathway to stimulate cancer-promoting immunity.},

We examined three pediatric tumors-medullobastoma, early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and retinoblastoma-that show multiple genomic structural variations within Wnt signaling pathways. We mathematically modeled this pathway to investigate the effects of cancer-related structural variations on Wnt signaling. Surprisingly, we found that an outcome measure of canonical Wnt signaling was consistently similar in matched cancer cells and normal cells, even in the context of different cancers, different mutations, and different Wnt-related genes. Our results suggest that the cancer cells maintain a normal level of Wnt signaling by developing multiple mutations.},

	abstract = {Using a retrovirus-mediated cDNA expression cloning approach, we identified the grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2) transcription factor as novel protooncogene. Overexpression of GRHL2 in NIH3T3 cells induced striking morphological changes, an increase in cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and tumor growth in vivo. By combining a microarray analysis and a phylogenetic footprinting analysis with various biochemical assays, we identified the epidermal growth factor receptor family member Erbb3 as a novel GRHL2 target gene. In breast cancer cell lines, shRNA-mediated knockdown of GRHL2 expression or functional inactivation of GRHL2 using dominant negative GRHL2 proteins induces down-regulation of ERBB3 gene expression, a striking reduction in cell proliferation, and morphological and phenotypical alterations characteristic of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), thus implying contradictory roles of GRHL2 in breast carcinogenesis. Interestingly, we could further demonstrate that expression of GRHL2 is directly suppressed by the transcription factor zinc finger enhancer-binding protein 1 (ZEB1), which in turn is a direct target for repression by GRHL2, suggesting that the EMT transcription factors GRHL2 and ZEB1 form a double negative regulatory feedback loop in breast cancer cells. Finally, a comprehensive immunohistochemical analysis of GRHL2 expression in primary breast cancers showed loss of GRHL2 expression at the invasive front of primary tumors. A pathophysiological relevance of GRHL2 in breast cancer metastasis is further demonstrated by our finding of a statistically significant association between loss of GRHL2 expression in primary breast cancers and lymph node metastasis. We thus demonstrate a crucial role of GRHL2 in breast carcinogenesis.},

A small isoform of SF/HGF encoded by a natural splice variant, which consists of the NH2-terminal hairpin structure and the first two kringle domains but not the protease homology region, induces cell motility but not mitogenesis. Two types of SF/HGF receptors have recently been discovered in epithelial cells, the high affinity c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase, and low affinity/high capacity binding sites, which are probably located on heparan sulfate proteoglycans. In the present study, we have addressed the question whether the various biological activities of SF/HGF are transduced into cells by a single type of receptor. We have here examined MDCK epithelial cells transfected with a hybrid cDNA encoding the ligand binding domain of the nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor and the membrane-spanning and tyrosine kinase domains of the Met receptor. We demonstrate that all biological effects of SF/HGF upon epithelial cells such as the induction of cell motility, proliferation, invasiveness, and tubular morphogenesis can now be triggered by the addition of NGF. Thus, it is likely that all known biological signals of SF/HGF are transduced through the receptor tyrosine kinase encoded by the c-Met protooncogene.},

However, in order to assign any degree of confidence to our conclusions, we must quantify these effects. Bootstrap resampling is one method by which this may be achieved. Here, we present a parametric bootstrapping approach for time-course data, in which Gaussian process regression (GPR) is used to fit a probabilistic model from which replicates may then be drawn. This approach implicitly allows the time dependence of the data to be taken into account, and is applicable to a wide range of problems. RESULTS:We apply GPR bootstrapping to two datasets from the literature. In the first example, we show how the approach may be used to investigate the effects of data uncertainty upon the estimation of parameters in an ordinary differential equations (ODE) model of a cell signalling pathway. Although we find that the parameter estimates inferred from the original dataset are relatively robust to data uncertainty, we also identify a distinct second set of estimates. In the second example, we use our method to show that the topology of networks constructed from time-course gene expression data appears to be sensitive to data uncertainty, although there may be individual edges in the network that are robust in light of present data.

	abstract = {Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key event in the generation of invasive tumor cells. A hallmark of EMT is the repression of E-cadherin expression, which is regulated by various signal transduction pathways including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Wnt. These pathways are highly interconnected via multiple coupled feedback loops (CFL). As the function of such coupled feedback regulations is difficult to analyze experimentally, we used a systems biology approach where computational models were designed to predict biological effects that result from the complex interplay of CFLs. Using epidermal growth factor (EGF) and Wnt as input and E-cadherin transcriptional regulation as output, we established an ordinary differential equation model of the ERK and Wnt signaling network containing six feedback links and used extensive computer simulations to analyze the effects of these feedback links in isolation and different combinations. The results show that the feedbacks can generate a rich dynamic behavior leading to various dose-response patterns and have a decisive role in determining network responses to EGF and Wnt. In particular, we made two important findings: first, that coupled positive feedback loops composed of phosphorylation of Raf kinase inhibitor RKIP by ERK and transcriptional repression of RKIP by Snail have an essential role in causing a switch-like behavior of E-cadherin expression; and second, that RKIP expression inhibits EMT progression by preventing E-cadherin suppression. Taken together, our findings provide us with a system-level understanding of how RKIP can regulate EMT progression and may explain why RKIP is downregulated in so many metastatic cancer cells.},

	abstract = {Negative binomial model has been increasingly used to model the count data in recent clinical trials. It is frequently chosen over Poisson model in cases of overdispersed count data that are commonly seen in clinical trials. One of the challenges of applying negative binomial model in clinical trial design is the sample size estimation. In practice, simulation methods have been frequently used for sample size estimation. In this paper, an explicit formula is developed to calculate sample size based on the negative binomial model. Depending on different approaches to estimate the variance under null hypothesis, three variations of the sample size formula are proposed and discussed. Important characteristics of the formula include its accuracy and its ability to explicitly incorporate dispersion parameter and exposure time. The performance of the formula with each variation is assessed using simulations.},

However, despite the prevalence of the term self-renewal in the scientific literature, this process has not been defined at the molecular level. Haematopoietic stem cells are an excellent model for the study of self-renewal because they can be isolated prospectively, manipulated relatively easily and assessed by using well-defined assays. Establishing the principles of self-renewal in haematopoietic stem cells will lead to insights into the mechanisms of self-renewal in other tissues.},

Previous attempts to map peptide MHC (pMHC) affinity onto T-cell responses have produced inconsistent patterns of responses, preventing formulations of canonical models of T-cell signaling. Here, a systematic analysis of T-cell responses to 1 million-fold variations in both pMHC affinity and dose produced bell-shaped dose-response curves and different optimal pMHC affinities at different pMHC doses. Using sequential model rejection/identification algorithms, we identified a unique, minimal model of cellular signaling incorporating kinetic proofreading with limited signaling coupled to an incoherent feed-forward loop (KPL-IFF) that reproduces these observations. We show that the KPL-IFF model correctly predicts the T-cell response to antigen copresentation. Our work offers a general approach for studying cellular signaling that does not require full details of biochemical pathways.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer stem cells (CSCs) are thought to drive recurrence and metastasis. Their identity has been linked to the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) but remains highly controversial since–depending on the cell-line studied–either epithelial (E) or mesenchymal (M) markers, alone or together have been associated with stemness. Using distinct transcript expression signatures characterizing the three different E, M and hybrid E/M cell-types, our data support a novel model that links a mixed EM signature with stemness in 1) individual cells, 2) luminal and basal cell lines, 3) in vivo xenograft mouse models, and 4) in all breast cancer subtypes. In particular, we found that co-expression of E and M signatures was associated with poorest outcome in luminal and basal breast cancer patients as well as with enrichment for stem-like cells in both E and M breast cell-lines. This link between a mixed EM expression signature and stemness was explained by two findings: first, mixed cultures of E and M cells showed increased cooperation in mammosphere formation (indicative of stemness) compared to the more differentiated E and M cell-types. Second, single-cell qPCR analysis revealed that E and M genes could be co-expressed in the same cell. These hybrid E/M cells were generated by both E or M cells and had a combination of several stem-like traits since they displayed increased plasticity, self-renewal, mammosphere formation, and produced ALDH1+ progenies, while more differentiated M cells showed less plasticity and E cells showed less self-renewal. Thus, the hybrid E/M state reflecting stemness and its promotion by E-M cooperation offers a dual biological rationale for the robust association of the mixed EM signature with poor prognosis, independent of cellular origin. Together, our model explains previous paradoxical findings that breast CSCs appear to be M in luminal cell-lines but E in basal breast cancer cell-lines. Our results suggest that targeting E/M heterogeneity by eliminating hybrid E/M cells and cooperation between E and M cell-types could improve breast cancer patient survival independent of breast cancer-subtype.},

With age this material, collectively called a plaque, enhances and blocks blood flow thereby altering the hemodynamics. If the plaque ruptures, the occlusion may cause a life-threating stroke or myocardial infarction. Although it is known that local biochemical and hemodynamics influence leukocyte adhesion and trans-endothelial migration into the wall, their effects on the growth rates of plaques are less known. Being able to identify crucial plaque shapes that are susceptible to rapid growth rates if left untreated will help treat plaques vulnerable to rupturing. Therefore, we developed an agent-based model capable of integrating cell behaviors and hemodynamic properties as the plaque grows, and identified crucial lumen volumes that give rise to favorable conditions for rapid plaque growth. Collectively, understanding how mechanobiological events are integrated within an artery will help elucidate emergent behaviors and predict plaque evolution.},

	abstract = {Interactions among drugs play a critical role in the killing efficacy of multi-drug treatments. Recent advances in theory and experiment for three-drug interactions enable the search for emergent interactions—ones not predictable from pairwise interactions. Previous work has shown it is easier to detect synergies and antagonisms among pairwise interactions when a rescaling method is applied to the interaction metric. However, no study has carefully examined whether new types of normalization might be needed for emergence. Here, we propose several rescaling methods for enhancing the classification of the higher order drug interactions based on our conceptual framework. To choose the rescaling that best separates synergism, antagonism and additivity, we conducted bacterial growth experiments in the presence of single, pairwise and triple-drug combinations among 14 antibiotics. We found one of our rescaling methods is far better at distinguishing synergistic and antagonistic emergent interactions than any of the other methods. Using our new method, we find around 50\% of emergent interactions are additive, much less than previous reports of greater than 90\% additivity. We conclude that higher order emergent interactions are much more common than previously believed, and we argue these findings for drugs suggest that appropriate rescaling is crucial to infer higher order interactions.},

Here, in a cohort of 30 patients, we show that MM composes 4 hierarchically organized, clonally related subpopulations, which, although phenotypically distinct, share the same oncogenic chromosomal abnormalities as well as immunoglobulin heavy chain comple- mentarity region 3 area sequence. Assessed in xenograft assays, myeloma-propagating activity is the exclusive property of a population characterized by its ability for bidirectional transition between the dominant CD19􏰠CD138􏰡 plasma cell (PC) and a low frequency CD19􏰠CD138􏰠 subpopulation (termed Pre-PC); in addition, Pre-PCs are more quiescent and unlike PCs, are primarily localized at extramedullary sites. As shown by gene expression profiling, compared with PCs, Pre-PCs are enriched in epigenetic regulators, suggesting that epigenetic plasticity underpins the phenotypic diversifica- tion of myeloma-propagating cells. Prospective assessment in paired, pretreatment, and posttreatment bone marrow samples shows that Pre-PCs are up to 300-fold more drug-resistant than PCs. Thus, clinical drug resistance in MM is linked to reversible, bidirectional phenotypic transition of myeloma-propagating cells. These novel biologic insights have important clinical implica- tions in relation to assessment of minimal residual disease and development of alternative therapeutic strategies in MM.},

	abstract = {The outbreak of Ebola that started in West Africa in late 2013 has caused at least 28,000 illnesses and 11,000 deaths. As the outbreak progressed, global and local public health authorities scrambled to contain the spread of the disease by isolating those who were ill, putting in place infection control processes in health care settings, and encouraging the public to take steps to prevent the spread of the illness in the community. It took a massive investment of resources and personnel from many countries to eventually bring the outbreak under control. To determine where to allocate people and resources during the outbreak, public health authorities often turned to mathematical models created by scientists to predict the course of the outbreak and identify interventions that could be effective. Many groups of scientists created models of the epidemic using publically available data or data they obtained from government officials or field studies. In some instances, the models yielded valuable insights. But with various groups using different methods and data, the models didn’t always agree on what would happen next or how best to contain the epidemic. Now, Chretien et al. provide an overview of Ebola mathematical modeling during the epidemic and suggest how future efforts may be improved. The overview included 66 published studies about Ebola outbreak models. Although most forecasts predicted many more cases than actually occurred, some modeling approaches produced more accurate predictions, and several models yielded valuable insights. For example, one study found that focusing efforts on isolating patients with the most severe cases of Ebola would help end the epidemic by substantially reducing the number of new infections. Another study used real-time airline data to predict which traveler screening strategies would be most efficient at preventing international spread of Ebola. Furthermore, studies that obtained genomic data showed how specific virus strains were transmitted across geographic areas. Chretien et al. argue that mathematical modeling efforts could be more useful in future pubic health emergencies if modelers cooperated more, and suggest the collaborative approach of weather forecasters as a good example to follow. Greater data sharing and the creation of standards for epidemic modeling would aid better collaboration.},

But some microbes have taken this relationship a step further and evolved the ability to manipulate the behavior of their host animals to their advantage. For example, certain fungi can hijack the nervous systems of ants, turning them into ‘zombies’ that are forced to climb to the precise height of a plant with the right conditions for the fungus to grow. Another fungus, called Entomophthora muscae, induces a similar behavior in flies. Like with the ants, this fungus forces the flies to climb to a high location and to attach themselves to the plant with their mouthparts, so providing a basis for the fungus to grow. Due to the lack of knowledge and tools that allow us to study the genes and cells of many of these host species, it remains unclear how these microbes can manipulate other animals and change their behavior. Now, Elya et al. wanted to find out whether this process can be examined in a well-known ‘model organism’, the fruit fly. The fruit flies were infected with E. muscae obtained from the wild and activity patterns in the genes of both organisms were tracked. One day after infection with the fungus, the flies developed a strong immune response to the invader, and many genes involved in the immune system were overactive. After two days, the fungus started to adopt the shape that eventually kills the flies and began to invade the nervous system. By the third day, the fungus had spread throughout the body and most flies died around four to five days following infection. Two to three hours after the flies had died, the digestive and reproductive systems had been consumed by the fungus and the nervous system was in the process of being degraded. Contrary to other infected organisms, the fungus got inside the fly’s nervous system during the early stages of infection. This could be an important clue as to how the fungus changes the fly’s behavior, but more research is needed to confirm this. The techniques developed in the study of Elya et al. can now be used to study how exactly microbes affect their hosts. A better knowledge of the relationship between these organisms will provide new insight into how animal behaviors are encoded and generated.},

Severe systemic inflammation can be induced and perpetuated by diverse insults such as the administration of toxic bacterial products (e.g., endotoxin), traumatic injury, and hemorrhage. Here, we probe whether these varied shock states can be explained by a universal inflammatory system that is initiated through different means and, once initiated, follows a course specified by the cellular and molecular mechanisms of the immune and endocrine systems. To examine this question, we developed a mathematical model incorporating major elements of the acute inflammatory response in C57Bl/6 mice, using input from experimental data. We found that a single model with different initiators including the autonomic system could describe the response to various insults. This model was able to predict a dose range of endotoxin at which mice would die despite having been calibrated only in nonlethal inflammatory paradigms. These results show that the complex biology of inflammation can be modeled and supports the hypothesis that shock states induced by a range of physiologic challenges could arise from a universal response that is differently initiated and modulated.},

By performing ligations on solid substrates rather than in solution, TCC substantially enhances the signal-to-noise ratio, thereby facilitating a detailed analysis of interactions within and between chromosomes. We identified a group of regions in each chromosome in human cells that account for the majority of interchromosomal interactions. These regions are marked by high transcriptional activity, suggesting that their interactions are mediated by transcriptional machinery. Each of these regions interacts with numerous other such regions throughout the genome in an indiscriminate fashion, partly driven by the accessibility of the partners. As a different combination of interactions is likely present in different cells, we developed a computational method to translate the TCC data into physical chromatin contacts in a population of three-dimensional genome structures. Statistical analysis of the resulting population demonstrates that the indiscriminate properties of interchromosomal interactions are consistent with the well-known architectural features of the human genome.},

By transiently priming cells for commitment to different lineages, these fluctuations are thought to be important to the maintenance of, and exit from, pluripotency. However, because temporal changes in intracellular protein abundances cannot be measured directly in live cells, fluctuations are typically assessed using genetically engineered reporter cell lines that produce a fluorescent signal as a proxy for protein expression. Here, using a combination of mathematical modeling and experiment, we show that there are unforeseen ways in which widely used reporter strategies can systematically disturb the dynamics they are intended to monitor, sometimes giving profoundly misleading results. In the case of Nanog, we show how genetic reporters can compromise the behavior of important pluripotency-sustaining positive feedback loops, and induce a bifurcation in the underlying dynamics that gives rise to heterogeneous Nanog expression patterns in reporter cell lines that are not representative of the wild-type. These findings help explain the range of published observations of Nanog variability and highlight the problem of measurement in live cells.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here we show that RNA velocity—the time derivative of the gene expression state—can be directly estimated by distinguishing between unspliced and spliced mRNAs in common single-cell RNA sequencing protocols. RNA velocity is a high-dimensional vector that predicts the future state of individual cells on a timescale of hours. We validate its accuracy in the neural crest lineage, demonstrate its use on multiple published datasets and technical platforms, reveal the branching lineage tree of the developing mouse hippocampus, and examine the kinetics of transcription in human embryonic brain.

Frequently such trafficking is not just for material transport, but also for information propagation, and serves to couple signaling circuits across cellular compartments. Here, I show that trafficking transforms simple local signaling pathways into self-organizing systems that span compartments and confer distinct states and identities to these compartments. I find that three motifs encapsulate the responses of most single-compartment signaling pathways in the context of trafficking. These motifs combine with different trafficking reactions to generate a diverse set of cellular functions. For example, trafficked bistable switches can oscillate or become quad- or tristable, depending on trafficking mechanisms and rates. Furthermore, the analysis shows how compartments participating in traffic can settle to distinct molecular compositions characteristic of distinct organelle identities. This general framework shows how the interplay between molecular movement and local reactions can generate many system functions, and give distinct identities to different parts of the cell.},

An E-series of two distinct types of hydrogels are ligand-functionalized here with non-fibrous collagen and used to elucidate wide-ranging cell and cytoskeletal responses to E in both 2D and 3D matrix geometries. Cross-linked hyaluronic acid (HA) based matrices as well as standard polyacrylamide (PA) hydrogels show that, within hours of initial plating, the adhesion, asymmetric shape, and cytoskeletal order within mesenchymal stem cells generally depend on E nonmonotonically over a broad range of physiologically relevant E. In particular, with overlays of a second matrix the stiffer of the upper or lower matrix dominates key cell responses to 3D: the cell invariably takes an elongated shape that couples to E in driving cytoplasmic stress fiber assembly. In contrast, embedding cells in homogeneous HA matrices constrains cells to spherically symmetric shapes in which E drives the assembly of a predominantly cortical cytoskeleton. Non-muscle myosin II generates the forces required for key cell responses and is a target of a phospho-Tyrosine signaling pathway that likely regulates contractile assemblies and also depends nonmonotonically on E. The results can be understood in part from a theory for stress fiber polarization that couples to matrix elasticity as well as cell shape and accurately predicts cytoskeletal order in 2D and 3D, regardless of polymer system.},

In this work, we study the transient properties of such systems and fully characterize their first passage (completion) time distributions. In particular, we provide explicit expressions for the mean and the variance of the completion time for a kinetic proofreading process and computational analyses for more complicated biochemical systems. We find that, for a wide range of parameters, as the system size grows, the completion time behavior simplifies: it becomes either deterministic or exponentially distributed, with a very narrow transition between the two regimes. In both regimes, the dynamical complexity of the full system is trivial compared to its apparent structural complexity. Similar simplicity is likely to arise in the dynamics of many complex multistep biochemical processes. In particular, these findings suggest not only that one may not be able to understand individual elementary reactions from macroscopic observations, but also that such an understanding may be unnecessary.},

	doi = {10.1073/pnas.1219813110},
	abstract = {How organs are shaped to specific forms is a fundamental issue in developmental biology. To address this question, we used the repetitive, periodic pattern of feather morphogenesis on chicken skin as a model. Avian feathers within a single tract extend from dome-shaped primordia to thin conical structures with a common axis of orientation. From a systems biology perspective, the process is precise and robust. Using tissue transplantation assays, we demonstrate that a "zone of polarizing activity," localized in the posterior feather bud, is necessary and sufficient to mediate the directional elongation. This region contains a spatially well-defined nuclear $\beta$-catenin zone, which is induced by wingless-int (Wnt)7a protein diffusing in from posterior bud epithelium. Misexpressing nuclear $\beta$-catenin randomizes feather polarity. This dermal nuclear $\beta$-catenin zone, surrounded by Notch1 positive dermal cells, induces Jagged1. Inhibition of Notch signaling disrupts the spatial configuration of the nuclear $\beta$-catenin zone and leads to randomized feather polarity. Mathematical modeling predicts that lateral inhibition, mediated by Notch signaling, functions to reduce Wnt7a gradient variations and fluctuations to form the sharp boundary observed for the dermal $\beta$-catenin zone. This zone is also enriched for nonmuscle myosin IIB. Suppressing nonmuscle myosin IIB disrupts directional cell rearrangements and abolishes feather bud elongation. These data suggest that a unique molecular module involving chemical-mechanical coupling converts a pliable chemical gradient to a precise domain, ready for subsequent mechanical action, thus defining the position, boundary, and duration of localized morphogenetic activity that molds the shape of growing organs.},

Mechanistic insight into signaling processes is often complicated because ubiquitous feedback loops obscure causal relationships. Consequently, the endogenous inputs of many nutrient signaling pathways remain unknown. Recent advances for system-wide experimental data generation have facilitated the quantification of signaling systems, but the integration of multi-level dynamic data remains challenging. Here, we co-designed dynamic experiments and a probabilistic, model-based method to infer causal relationships between metabolism, signaling, and gene regulation. We analyzed the dynamic regulation of nitrogen metabolism by the target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) pathway in budding yeast. Dynamic transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic measurements along shifts in nitrogen quality yielded a consistent dataset that demonstrated extensive re-wiring of cellular networks during adaptation. Our inference method identified putative downstream targets of TORC1 and putative metabolic inputs of TORC1, including the hypothesized glutamine signal. The work provides a basis for further mechanistic studies of nitrogen metabolism and a general computational framework to study cellular processes. ![][1]{\textless}/img{\textgreater} Dynamic experiments and a computational method are co-designed to infer causal interactions between metabolism, signaling and transcription.

To this end a variety of cell-based modelling approaches have been developed, ranging in complexity from lattice-based cellular automata to lattice-free models that treat cells as point-like particles or extended shapes. However, it remains unclear how these approaches compare when applied to the same biological problem, and under which circumstances each approach is valid. Here we implement five classes of such model in a consistent computational framework, Chaste. We apply each model to four simulation studies, chosen to illustrate how the cellular processes such as proliferation, adhesion, and short- and long-range signalling may be implemented in each model. These case studies demonstrate the applicability of each model and highlight where one may expect to see qualitative differences between model behaviours. Taken together, these findings provide a guide for model usage.},

	abstract = {Previously, we have modeled hematopoietic stem cell organization by a stochastic, single cell-based approach. Applications to different experimental systems demonstrated that this model consistently explains a broad variety of in vivo and in vitro data. A major advantage of the agent-based model (ABM) is the representation of heterogeneity within the hematopoietic stem cell population. However, this advantage comes at the price of time-consuming simulations if the systems become large. One example in this respect is the modeling of disease and treatment dynamics in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), where the realistic number of individual cells to be considered exceeds 10(6). To overcome this deficiency, without losing the representation of the inherent heterogeneity of the stem cell population, we here propose to approximate the ABM by a system of partial differential equations (PDEs). The major benefit of such an approach is its independence from the size of the system. Although this mean field approach includes a number of simplifying assumptions compared to the ABM, it retains the key structure of the model including the "age"-structure of stem cells. We show that the PDE model qualitatively and quantitatively reproduces the results of the agent-based approach.},

Though the elements regulating cellular states have been identified, the underlying dynamic mechanisms and the significance of such cellular heterogeneity remain elusive. We present a gene regulatory network model to investigate the bimodal Nanog distribution in stem cells. Our model reveals a novel role of dynamic conversion between the cellular states of high and low Nanog levels. Model simulations demonstrate that the low-Nanog state benefits cell differentiation through serving as an intermediate state to reduce the barrier of transition. Interestingly, the existence of low-Nanog state dynamically slows down the reprogramming process, and additional Nanog activation is found to be essential to quickly attaining the fully reprogrammed cell state. Nanog has been recognized as a critical pluripotency gene in stem cell regulation. Our modeling results quantitatively show a dual role of Nanog during stem cell differentiation and reprogramming, and the importance of the intermediate state during cell state transitions. Our approach offers a general method for analyzing key regulatory factors controlling cell differentiation and reprogramming.},

Understanding population-wide clone size distributions in vivo is complicated by multiple cell types within observed tissues, and overlapping birth and death processes. This has led to the increased need for mathematically informed models to understand their biological significance. Standard approaches usually require knowledge of clonal age. We show that modelling on clone size independent of time is an alternative method that offers certain analytical advantages; it can help parametrize these models, and obtain distributions for counts of mutated or proliferating cells, for example. When applied to a general birth–death process common in epithelial progenitors, this takes the form of a gambler's ruin problem, the solution of which relates to counting Motzkin lattice paths. Applying this approach to mutational processes, alternative, exact, formulations of classic Luria–Delbrück-type problems emerge. This approach can be extended beyond neutral models of mutant clonal evolution. Applications of these approaches are twofold. First, we resolve the probability of progenitor cells generating proliferating or differentiating progeny in clonal lineage tracing experiments in vivo or cell culture assays where clone age is not known. Second, we model mutation frequency distributions that deep sequencing of subclonal samples produce.},

The value of the density at some point in time is directly accessible by the solution of the original ODE extended by a single extra dimension (for the value of the density). This leads to simple methods for studying uncertainty, variability and likelihood, with significant advantages over more traditional Monte Carlo and related approaches especially when studying regions with low probability.

	doi = {10.7554/eLife.33423},
	abstract = {Gene drive is a genetic engineering technology that can spread a particular suite of genes throughout a population. Among the types of gene drive systems, those based on the CRISPR genome editing technology are predicted to be able to spread genes particularly rapidly. This is because components of the CRISPR system can be tailored to replace alternative copies of a particular gene, ensuring that only the desired version is passed on to offspring. In this way, for example, a gene that prevents mosquitoes from carrying or transmitting the malaria parasite could be introduced to a very large wild population to reduce the incidence of the disease among humans. Gene drives can be “self-propagating” or “self-exhausting”: the former are designed so that they can always spread as long as there are wild organisms around, whereas the latter are expected to lose their ability to spread over time. Self-propagating CRISPR gene drives have been shown to work in controlled populations of fruit flies, mosquitoes and yeast. These experiments happen in a controlled environment in the laboratory, so the organisms edited to have the gene drive elements do not come in contact with susceptible wild organisms. However, if just a few were to escape, the gene drive could theoretically spread quickly outside the laboratory. Noble, Adlam et al. investigated, using mathematical models, whether or not – and how fast – a self-propagating CRISPR-based gene drive would spread if a number of organisms with the gene-drive elements were released into the wild. The models showed that the release of just a few of the edited organisms would result in the gene drive spreading to most populations that interbreed. This happened regardless of the structure of the wild populations or whether a degree of resistance to the drive emerged. As a result, even the smallest breach of a contained trial could lead to significant gene drive spread in the wild. The findings suggest that self-propagating gene drive technologies would be most useful where the invasion of most wild populations of the target species is the intended purpose, rather than a risk to be avoided. As a result, a self-propagating CRISPR-based gene drive could be well suited to spreading among mosquitoes to impede the malaria parasite, provided there were strong international agreements in place. The findings also underline the difficulty of carrying out safe field trials of self-propagating gene drives, and the need for very tight control of laboratories carrying out experiments in this field. Lastly, they highlight the importance of developing and testing the evolutionary stability of self-exhausting gene drives, which could be better contained to local populations.},

	doi = {10.7554/eLife.34820},
	abstract = {When most people think about evolution, they commonly think of natural selection: the evolutionary force that helps populations to develop toward an optimum state for their environment. The observable traits and features of a cell or organism are known as its phenotype. Under natural selection, genes that produce phenotypes that help a cell or organism to thrive and reproduce are more likely to be passed on to future generations. This means that over several generations the population becomes – on average – better adapted to its environment. Other ‘non-adaptive’ evolutionary forces also influence phenotype. For example, damage to DNA can introduce mutations into the genes that a cell or organism passes on to their offspring. Some mutations are more likely to produce working variants of a gene than others; this is known as a mutation bias. In addition, even in the absence of natural selection, the proportion of particular gene variants in a population changes over the generations because genes are randomly transmitted and not all individuals reproduce. This is known as genetic drift. Together, mutation bias and genetic drift could prevent a population’s average phenotype from reaching an optimal state. Lynch has now developed mathematical models that describe how certain biological features of cells – such as the structure of the proteins they produce – are likely to evolve due to mutation bias and genetic drift. These models show that these evolutionary processes can cause the features of the cells in a population to diversify, which often leads to a suboptimal average phenotype. Lynch calculated that two alternative phenotypes could even emerge in isolated populations in cases where there is only one optimum phenotype. For example, a mutation bias could drive some cells in one population to evolve one phenotype, while natural selection drives another population towards the other phenotype. Overall, the model emphasizes that natural selection is not the only force that drives diversity in cells. Future research into cell biology needs to take a broad view of the joint roles played by natural selection, mutation bias and genetic drift.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:During embryogenesis, signaling molecules produced by one cell population direct gene regulatory changes in neighboring cells and influence their developmental fates and spatial organization. One of the earliest events in the development of the vertebrate embryo is the establishment of three germ layers, consisting of the ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. Attempts to measure gene expression in vivo in different germ layers and cell types are typically complicated by the heterogeneity of cell types within biological samples (i.e., embryos), as the responses of individual cell types are intermingled into an aggregate observation of heterogeneous cell types. Here, we propose a novel method to elucidate gene regulatory circuits from these aggregate measurements in embryos of the frog Xenopus tropicalis using gene network inference algorithms and then test the ability of the inferred networks to predict spatial gene expression patterns. RESULTS:We use two inference models with different underlying assumptions that incorporate existing network information, an ODE model for steady-state data and a Markov model for time series data, and contrast the performance of the two models. We apply our method to both control and knockdown embryos at multiple time points to reconstruct the core mesoderm and endoderm regulatory circuits. Those inferred networks are then used in combination with known dorsal-ventral spatial expression patterns of a subset of genes to predict spatial expression patterns for other genes. Both models are able to predict spatial expression patterns for some of the core mesoderm and endoderm genes, but interestingly of different gene subsets, suggesting that neither model is sufficient to recapitulate all of the spatial patterns, yet they are complementary for the patterns that they do capture. CONCLUSION:The presented methodology of gene network inference combined with spatial pattern prediction provides an additional layer of validation to elucidate the regulatory circuits controlling the spatial-temporal dynamics in embryonic development.},

A potential solution is to engineer a kidney-like tissue capable of performing differentiated renal functions. These functions are strikingly dependent upon appropriate three-dimensional relationships established during development, including those arising from branching morphogenesis of the ureteric bud. RECENT FINDINGS:The ureteric bud, an 'iterative tip-stalk generator' (ITSG) forming the scaffold around which the kidney is built, can be cultured and propagated ex vivo while retaining the capacity to induce and appropriately interact with nascent nephrons. Progress has been made toward construction of a ureteric bud from cells. SUMMARY:The myriad functions of the kidney are critically dependent upon its three-dimensional spatial architecture established by branching of the ureteric bud. Ureteric bud branching morphogenesis can be recapitulated ex vivo; we discuss how this intrinsic property of the ureteric bud might be exploited for engineering of kidney-like tissues potentially useful for the treatment of chronic kidney disease, acute kidney injury, and/or other renal diseases.},

We aimed to determine the safety and feasibility of treatment with CD34+ cells delivered intra-arterially in patients with acute ischemic stroke. This was the first study in human subjects. We performed a prospective, nonrandomized, open-label, phase I study of autologous, immunoselected CD34+ stem/progenitor cell therapy in patients presenting within 7 days of onset with severe anterior circulation ischemic stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] score \${\textbackslash}ge\$8). CD34+ cells were collected from the bone marrow of the subjects before being delivered by catheter angiography into the ipsilesional middle cerebral artery. Eighty-two patients with severe anterior circulation ischemic stroke were screened, of whom five proceeded to treatment. The common reasons for exclusion were age {\textgreater}80 years (n = 19); medical instability (n = 17), and significant carotid stenosis (n = 13). The procedure was well tolerated in all patients, and no significant treatment-related adverse effects occurred. All patients showed improvements in clinical functional scores (Modified Rankin Score and NIHSS score) and reductions in lesion volume during a 6-month follow-up period. Autologous CD34+ selected stem/progenitor cell therapy delivered intra-arterially into the infarct territory can be achieved safely in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Future studies that address eligibility criteria, dosage, delivery site, and timing and that use surrogate imaging markers of outcome are desirable before larger scale clinical trials.},

The size of the sampling interval significantly affects the tracking measurements, the statistics computed from observed trajectories, and the inferences drawn. Despite the widespread use of tracking data to investigate motile behaviour, many open questions remain about these effects. We use a correlated random walk model to study the variation with sampling interval of two key quantities of interest: apparent speed and angle change. Two variants of the model are considered, in which reorientations occur instantaneously and with a stationary pause, respectively. We employ stochastic simulations to study the effect of sampling on the distributions of apparent speeds and angle changes, and present novel mathematical analysis in the case of rapid sampling. Our investigation elucidates the complex nature of sampling effects for sampling intervals ranging over many orders of magnitude. Results show that inclusion of a stationary phase significantly alters the observed distributions of both quantities.},

	abstract = {The lack of effective biomarkers for predicting cancer risk in premalignant disease is a major clinical problem. There is a near-limitless list of candidate biomarkers, and it remains unclear how best to sample the tissue in space and time. Practical constraints mean that only a few of these candidate biomarker strategies can be evaluated empirically, and there is no framework to determine which of the plethora of possibilities is the most promising. Here, we have sought to solve this problem by developing a theoretical platform for in silico biomarker development. We construct a simple computational model of carcinogenesis in premalignant disease and use the model to evaluate an extensive list of tissue sampling strategies and different molecular measures of these samples. Our model predicts that (i) taking more biopsies improves prognostication, but with diminishing returns for each additional biopsy; (ii) longitudinally collected biopsies provide slightly more prognostic information than a single biopsy collected at the latest possible time point; (iii) measurements of clonal diversity are more prognostic than measurements of the presence or absence of a particular abnormality and are particularly robust to confounding by tissue sampling; and (iv) the spatial pattern of clonal expansions is a particularly prognostic measure. This study demonstrates how the use of a mechanistic framework provided by computational modeling can diminish empirical constraints on biomarker development.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE:At present, no dynamic quantitative models of stem cell organization are available that fulfill all criteria of the prevalent functional definition of hematopoietic stem cells and, at the same time, provide a consistent explanation of cell kinetic and functional stem cell heterogeneity, reversibility of cellular properties, self-organized regeneration after damage, fluctuating activity and competition of stem cell clones, and microenvironment dependency of stem cell quality. To solve this problem, we propose a new, comprehensive model concept. MATERIALS AND METHODS:A single cell-based stochastic model is described. It makes the novel concept of within-tissue plasticity operational. Within a range of potential options, individual cells may reversibly change their actual set of properties depending on the influence of the local growth environment. Stochastic switching between the growth environments introduces fluctuations that eventually generate heterogeneity. Extensive model simulations are compared with experimental data. RESULTS:Although stemness is not an explicit cellular model property, the system behavior is consistent with the functional definition of stem cells and explains a large set of experimental observations on stem cell function in vivo and in vitro on the level of cell populations and individual cells. Classic results such as the colony-forming unit spleen assay, as well as recent experimental observations on stem cell kinetics, individual clone tracking, and fluctuating clonal contribution, are discussed. CONCLUSIONS:This concept introduces a fundamentally new perspective on stem cell organization treating stemness not as an explicit cellular property but as the result of a dynamic process of self-organization. The model needs to be extended to incorporate lineage specification and tissue plasticity.},

Furthermore, we show that, in adenomatous crypts (APC(-/-)), there is a proportionate increase in both functional stem cell number and the loss/replacement rate. Finally, by analyzing fields of mtDNA mutant crypts, we show that a normal colon crypt divides around once every 30-40 years, and the division rate is increased in adenomas by at least an order of magnitude.

In this context, fundamental questions arise: how can the architecture of gene regulatory networks generate, make use of or be constrained by expression noise? Here, we discuss the interplay between expression noise and gene regulatory network at different levels of organization, ranging from a single regulatory interaction to entire regulatory networks. We then consider how this interplay impacts a variety of phenomena, such as pathogenicity, disease, adaptation to changing environments, differential cell-fate outcome and incomplete or partial penetrance effects.

	doi = {10.7554/eLife.25950},
	abstract = {Every year, antibiotics save millions of lives, but this may not last forever. The bacteria that cause infections are getting smarter and continuously evolve genes to become resistant to antibiotics, which makes it harder to kill them. In many cases, using stronger drugs can bypass this problem, but some 'super-bugs' are developing resistance to every drug we have. For example, the bacterium Acinetobacter baumannii has recently been classified as a global threat that kills thousands of people every year, which placed it on a top six 'most wanted' list for multi drug-resistant bacteria. Worryingly, this drug resistance seems to develop faster than 'standard' evolution would allow, making it difficult to keep up with developing new effective drugs. One way bacteria can shortcut the evolution of resistance is through a process called horizontal gene transfer, in which they collect resistance genes from other bacteria. Some bacteria can speed up this gene transfer by actively killing their neighbors to extract their DNA. However, until now, this process has not been observed directly, and it was not fully understood where and when killing neighbors becomes important for gene transfer. Now, Cooper, Tsimring and Hasty have studied a relative of A. baumannii called A. baylyi. Together with another type of bacteria that contained green fluorescence genes, A. baylyi was placed onto a surface that allowed both species to grow. As the two types of bacteria grew together, A. baylyi started to kill the other one and stole their genes. This happened so often that some started to become fluorescent, which could be observed in real time under a microscope. A. baylyi also stole genes for antibiotic resistance, and when an antibiotic was added, the bacteria with the stolen resistance genes kept growing and dividing, while the others were killed. Cooper et al. then developed a mathematical model to quantify and simulate this killing-enhanced horizontal gene transfer. The results showed that killing other bacteria made gene transfer more effective when the number of A. baylyi was high and the number of 'victims' was low – and also when they were together for a shorter period. This work may help to explain how Acinetobacter and similar bacteria develop drug resistance so quickly. A next step will be to measure and compare gene transfer parameters in different types of bacteria. A better understanding of how, where, and when gene transfer happens, may in the future help to guide strategies to fight resistance.},

Sequencing based approaches that average together many cells have suggested that polymerase binding and polymerase release from promoter proximal pausing are two key regulated steps in the transcriptional process. However, single cell studies have revealed that transcription occurs in short, discontinuous bursts, suggesting that transcriptional burst initiation and termination might also be regulated steps. Here, we develop and apply a quantitative framework to connect changes in both Pol II ChIP sequencing and single cell transcriptional measurements to changes in the rates of specific steps of transcription. Using a number of global and targeted transcriptional regulatory perturbations, we show that burst initiation rate is indeed a key regulated step, demonstrating that transcriptional activity can be frequency modulated. Polymerase pause release is a second key regulated step, but the rate of polymerase binding is not changed by any of the biological perturbations we examined. Our results establish an important role for transcriptional burst regulation in the control of gene expression.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

To investigate how stem cells achieve perfect self-renewal, emphasis has been placed on models in which stem cells progress sequentially through a one-way proliferative hierarchy. However, investigations of tissue regeneration have revealed a surprising degree of flexibility, with cells normally committed to differentiation able to recover stem cell competence following injury. Here, we investigate whether the reversible transfer of cells between states poised for proliferation or differentiation may provide a viable mechanism for a heterogeneous stem cell population to maintain homeostasis even under normal physiological conditions. By addressing the clonal dynamics, we show that such models of "dynamic heterogeneity" may be equally capable of describing the results of recent lineage tracing assays involving epithelial tissues. Moreover, together with competition for limited niche access, such models may provide a mechanism to render tissue homeostasis robust. In particular, in 2D epithelial layers, we show that the mechanism of dynamic heterogeneity avoids some pathological dependencies that undermine models based on a hierarchical stem/progenitor organization.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The control of highly infectious diseases of agricultural and plantation crops and livestock represents a key challenge in epidemiological and ecological modelling, with implemented control strategies often being controversial. Mathematical models, including the spatio-temporal stochastic models considered here, are playing an increasing role in the design of control as agencies seek to strengthen the evidence on which selected strategies are based. Here, we investigate a general approach to informing the choice of control strategies using spatio-temporal models within the Bayesian framework. We illustrate the approach for the case of strategies based on pre-emptive removal of individual hosts. For an exemplar model, using simulated data and historic data on an epidemic of Asiatic citrus canker in Florida, we assess a range of measures for prioritizing individuals for removal that take account of observations of an emerging epidemic. These measures are based on the potential infection hazard a host poses to susceptible individuals (hazard), the likelihood of infection of a host (risk) and a measure that combines both the hazard and risk (threat). We find that the threat measure typically leads to the most effective control strategies particularly for clustered epidemics when resources are scarce. The extension of the methods to a range of other settings is discussed. A key feature of the approach is the use of functional-model representations of the epidemic model to couple epidemic trajectories under different control strategies. This induces strong positive correlations between the epidemic outcomes under the respective controls, serving to reduce both the variance of the difference in outcomes and, consequently, the need for extensive simulation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In particular, to what extent do multi-functional circuits contain modules which reflect the different functions? Here, we computationally survey a range of bi-functional circuits which show no simple structural modularity: They can switch between two qualitatively distinct functions, while both functions depend on all genes of the circuit. Our analysis reveals two distinct classes: hybrid circuits which overlay two simpler mono-functional sub-circuits within their circuitry, and emergent circuits, which do not. In this second class, the bi-functionality emerges from more complex designs which are not fully decomposable into distinct modules and are consequently less intuitive to predict or understand. These non-intuitive emergent circuits are just as robust as their hybrid counterparts, and we therefore suggest that the common bias toward studying modular systems may hinder our understanding of real biological circuits. ![][1]{\textless}/img{\textgreater} A computational survey of simple bi-functional gene circuits reveals a spectrum of possible modularity.

This result demonstrates that intestinal stem cells form an equipotent population in which the loss of a stem cell is compensated by the multiplication of a neighbor, leading to neutral drift dynamics in which clones expand and contract at random until they either take over the crypt or they are lost. Combined with long-term clonal fate data, we show that the rate of stem cell replacement is comparable to the cell division rate, implying that neutral drift and symmetrical cell divisions are central to stem cell homeostasis.},

	abstract = {Author Summary For the prediction of therapeutic targets and the design of therapies, it is important to study the same pathway across different cell types. This is particularly relevant for cancer research, where several cell types are involved in carcinogenesis. Pancreatic cancer is enhanced by activated pancreatic stellate cells. It would thus seem plausible for an effective therapy to hit stellate and cancer cells. The cytokine IFNγ is an inhibitor of proliferation in both cell types. Antiproliferative effects of IFNγ are mediated by STAT1 signalling. An important aspect is to determine those reactions that cause the differences in the initial increase of phosphorylated STAT1 and in the temporal profile of STAT1 nuclear accumulation between the two cell types. We examined this aspect by performing a parameter identifiability analysis for calibrated mathematical models. We calculated confidence intervals of the estimated parameter values and found that they provide insights into reactions underlying the differences. A key finding of sensitivity analysis elucidated that predicted targets for enhancement of STAT1 activity are robust against parameter uncertainty and moreover they are robust between the two cell types. Our case study therefore exemplified how identifiability and sensitivity analysis can provide a basis for the prediction of potential therapeutic targets.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Several Cre reporter strains of mice have been described, in which a lacZ gene is turned on in cells expressing Cre recombinase, as well as their daughter cells, following Cre-mediated excision of a loxP-flanked transcriptional "stop" sequence. These mice are useful for cell lineage tracing experiments as well as for monitoring the expression of Cre transgenes. The green fluorescent protein (GFP) and variants such as EYFP and ECFP offer an advantage over lacZ as a reporter, in that they can be easily visualized without recourse to the vital substrates required to visualize beta-gal in living tissue. RESULTS:In view of the general utility of targeting the ubiquitously expressed ROSA26 locus, we constructed a generic ROSA26 targeting vector. We then generated two reporter lines of mice by inserting EYFP or ECFP cDNAs into the ROSA26 locus, preceded by a loxP-flanked stop sequence. These strains were tested by crossing them with transgenic strains expressing Cre in a ubiquitous (beta-actin-Cre) or a cell-specific (Isl1-Cre and En1-Cre) pattern. The resulting EYFP or ECFP expression patterns indicated that the reporter strains function as faithful monitors of Cre activity. CONCLUSIONS:In contrast to existing lacZ reporter lines, where lacZ expression cannot easily be detected in living tissue, the EYFP and ECFP reporter strains are useful for monitoring the expression of Cre and tracing the lineage of these cells and their descendants in cultured embryos or organs. The non-overlapping emission spectra of EYFP and ECFP make them ideal for double labeling studies in living tissues.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Gene expression is controlled by networks of transcription factors and regulators, but the structure of these networks is as yet poorly understood and is thus inferred from data. Recent work has shown the efficacy of information theoretical approaches for network reconstruction from single cell transcriptomic data. Such methods use information to estimate dependence between every pair of genes in the dataset, then edges are inferred between top-scoring pairs. Dependence, however, does not indicate significance, and the definition of "top-scoring" is often arbitrary and a priori related to expected network size. This makes comparing networks across datasets difficult, because networks of a similar size are not necessarily similarly accurate. We present a method for performing formal hypothesis tests on putative network edges derived from information theory, bringing together empirical Bayes and work on theoretical null distributions for information measures. Thresholding based on empirical Bayes allows us to control network accuracy according to how we intend to use the network. Using single cell data from mouse pluripotent stem cells, we recover known interactions and suggest several new interactions for experimental validation (using a stringent threshold) and discover high-level interactions between sub-networks (using a more relaxed threshold). Furthermore, our method allows for the inclusion of prior information. We use \textit{in-silico} data to show that even relatively poor quality prior information can increase the accuracy of a network, and demonstrate that the accuracy of networks inferred from single cell data can sometimes be improved by priors from population-level ChIP-Seq and qPCR data.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Cell fate and morphogenesis within the embryo is dependent upon secreted molecules that transduce signals between neighboring tissues. Reciprocal mesenchymal-epithelial interactions have proven essential during branching morphogenesis and cell differentiation within the lung; however, the interactions that result in lung specification from the foregut endoderm, prior to lung bud formation, are poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the tissue requirements and signals necessary for specification of a pulmonary cell fate using embryo tissue explants. We show that NKX2.1, an early transcription factor crucial for lung development, is expressed in the ventral foregut endoderm shortly after albumin and Pdx1, early markers of the liver and pancreas lineages, respectively. Similar to hepatic specification, direct contact of cardiac mesoderm with ventral endoderm is required to induce in vitro expression of NKX2.1 and downstream lung target genes including surfactant protein C and Clara cell secretory protein. In the absence of cardiac mesoderm, ventral foregut endoderm explants respond to exogenous fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 1 and FGF2 in a dose-dependent manner, with lower concentrations activating liver specific genes and higher concentrations activating lung specific genes. This signaling appears to be instructive, as the prospective dorsal midgut endoderm, which predominantly gives rise to the intestinal tract, is competent to respond to FGFs by inducing NKX2.1. Furthermore, the temporal expression and selective inhibition of FGF receptors 1 and 4 present within the endoderm implies that signaling through FGFR4 is involved in specifying lung versus liver. Together, the findings suggest that a concentration threshold of FGFs emanating from the cardiac mesoderm are involved in patterning the foregut endoderm.},

Chimeric mice carrying the fusion gene developed tumors, which were restricted to acute myeloid leukemias despite the widespread activity of the Mll promoter.

Increasing the number of endothelial cells or blood vessels in orthotopic brain tumor xenografts expanded the fraction of self-renewing cells and accelerated the initiation and growth of tumors.

Each population has a Go compartment, consisting of resting cells, that acts as a control center to determine the rate of proliferation. These rates are assumed to depend on the total number of cells in the combined populations. The presence of the leukemic population destabilizes the homeostatic state of the normal population, which is stable in the absence of leukemic cells, and drives the system to a new stable state consisting entirely of leukemic cells and no normal cells.

This approach allows description of the behavior of an unobserved population (ie, HSCs) on the basis of the behavior of observed progeny cells (ie, granulocytes and lymphocytes). The results of previous limiting-dilution, competitive-repopulation studies in 44 mice were compared with the results of simulated transplantation studies to identify parameters that led to comparable outcomes. Using this approach, we estimated that murine HSCs replicate (on average) once every 2.5 weeks and that the frequency of murine HSCs is 8 per 10(5) nucleated marrow cells. If it is assumed that short-term repopulating cells are distinct from HSCs, that they contribute to hemopoiesis early after transplantation, and that they are independently regulated, a frequency of 4 HSCs per 10(5) nucleated marrow cells also allows simulations that best approximate the observed data. When stochastic modeling and computer simulation were applied to limiting-dilution, autologous-transplantation studies in cats heterozygous for glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase, different estimates of HSC replication rate (1 per 8.3-10 weeks) and frequency (6 per 10(7) cells) were derived. Therefore, it appears that these parameters vary inversely with increased longevity, size, or both. An implication of these data is that human HSCs may be less frequent and replicate more slowly. These findings on cell kinetics have several implications.},

	abstract = {Author Summary Increasing antibiotic resistance, coupled with the slowing rate of discovery of novel antibiotic agents, is a public health threat which could soon reach crisis point. Indeed, the last decade has seen the emergence of deadly, highly resistant forms of pathogens, such as Escherichia coli , Acenitobacter baumanii , Klebsiella pneumoniae , Enterococcus and Staphylococcus aureus as well as non–bacterial pathogens including malaria and viruses such as HIV. Here, we develop a mathematical model of an evolving bacterial population, which allows us to predict the probability of resistant strains emerging. Using this model we show how sequences of drugs can be prescribed in order to prevent resistance where each drug alone may fail. These model predictions suggest a novel treatment strategy: using sequences of antibiotics to ‘steer’ the evolution of a pathogen to a configuration from which resistance to a final antibiotic cannot emerge. Further, we test the likelihood of resistance emerging when arbitrary sequences of antibiotics are prescribed, finding that approximately 70\% of arbitrary sequences of 2–4 drugs promote resistance to the final drug. This result serves as a cautionary warning that we may be inadvertently promoting resistance through careless (or random) prescription of drugs.},

Here, we report the isolation of the earliest myeloid-restricted progenitors in acute infection with the rodent malaria parasite, Plasmodium chabaudi. The rapid disappearance of these infection-induced myeloid progenitors from the bone marrow (BM) equated with contraction of the functional myeloid potential in that organ. The loss of BM myelopoiesis was not affected by the complete genetic inactivation of toll-like receptor signaling. De-activation of IFN-γ signaling completely abrogated the contraction of BM myeloid progenitors. Radiation chimeras of Ifngr1-null and control BM revealed that IFN-γ signaling in an irradiation-resistant stromal compartment was crucial for the loss of early myeloid progenitors. Systemic IFN-γ triggered the secretion of C-C motif ligand chemokines CCL2 and CCL7 leading to the egress of early, myeloid-committed progenitors from the bone marrow mediated by their common receptor CCR2. The mobilization of myeloid progenitors initiated extramedullary myelopoiesis in the spleen in a CCR2-dependent manner resulting in augmented myelopoiesis during acute malaria. Consistent with the lack of splenic myelopoiesis in the absence of CCR2 we observed a significant persistence of parasitemia in malaria infected CCR2-deficient hosts. Our findings reveal how the activated immune system mobilizes early myeloid progenitors out of the BM thereby transiently establishing myelopoiesis in the spleen in order to contain and resolve the infection locally.},

	abstract = {Genetic instability is invoked in explaining the cell phenotype changes that take place during cancer progression. However, the coexistence of a vast diversity of distinct clones, most prominently visible in the form of non-clonal chromosomal aberrations, suggests that Darwinian selection of mutant cells is not operating at maximal efficacy. Conversely, non-genetic instability of cancer cells must also be considered. Such mutation-independent instability of cell states is most prosaically manifest in the phenotypic heterogeneity within clonal cell populations or in the reversible switching between immature "cancer stem cell-like" and more differentiated states. How are genetic and non-genetic instability related to each other? Here, we review basic theoretical foundations and offer a dynamical systems perspective in which cancer is the inevitable pathological manifestation of modes of malfunction that are immanent to the complex gene regulatory network of the genome. We explain in an accessible, qualitative, and permissively simplified manner the mathematical basis for the "epigenetic landscape" and how the latter relates to the better known "fitness landscape." We show that these two classical metaphors have a formal basis. By combining these two landscape concepts, we unite development and somatic evolution as the drivers of the relentless increase in malignancy. Herein, the cancer cells are pushed toward cancer attractors in the evolutionarily unused regions of the epigenetic landscape that encode more and more "dedifferentiated" states as a consequence of both genetic (mutagenic) and non-genetic (regulatory) perturbations-including therapy. This would explain why for the cancer cell, the principle of "What does not kill me makes me stronger" is as much a driving force in tumor progression and development of drug resistance as the simple principle of "survival of the fittest."},

Several distinct epithelial subpopulations have been proposed, but complete understanding of the spectrum of heterogeneity and differentiation hierarchy in the human breast remains elusive. Here, we use single-cell mRNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to profile the transcriptomes of 25,790 primary human breast epithelial cells isolated from reduction mammoplasties of seven individuals. Unbiased clustering analysis reveals the existence of three distinct epithelial cell populations, one basal and two luminal cell types, which we identify as secretory L1- and hormone-responsive L2-type cells. Pseudotemporal reconstruction of differentiation trajectories produces one continuous lineage hierarchy that closely connects the basal lineage to the two differentiated luminal branches. Our comprehensive cell atlas provides insights into the cellular blueprint of the human breast epithelium and will form the foundation to understand how the system goes awry during breast cancer.},

In this paper, we show that the spectral information holds reliable indicators of intra- and interspecies variations, which can be related to the environment, selective pressures and fitness. Moreover, we show how the technical and pragmatic aspects of this modality (non-destructive, non-labelling, speed, relative low cost, etc.) enable it to be combined with more conventional methodologies.

This process is important during physiological processes, such as wound healing, and can also contribute to metastatic progression of cancer. Zhang et al. performed population and single-cell analysis of changes in the abundance of core regulators of EMT in a mammary epithelial cell line culture to test theoretical models by which EMT could occur. Their analysis confirmed that two sequential feedback loops, involving transcription factors and microRNAs, function as two cascading switches to control the discrete steps in EMT and identified the first step in this two-step process as the only readily reversible one for these cells.},

While many known regulatory mechanisms may reduce fluctuations in signals, most simultaneously influence their mean dynamics, leading to unfaithful cell fates. Through analysis and computation, we demonstrate that a reversible signaling mechanism acting through intermediate states can reduce noise while maintaining the mean. This mean-independent noise control (MINC) mechanism is investigated in the context of an intracellular binding protein that regulates retinoic acid (RA) signaling during zebrafish hindbrain development. By comparing our models with experimental data, we find that a MINC mechanism allows for sharp boundaries of gene expression without sacrificing boundary accuracy. In addition, this MINC mechanism can modulate noise to levels that we show are beneficial to spatial patterning through noise-induced cell fate switching. These results reveal a design principle that may be important for noise regulation in many systems that control cell fate determination.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Current models of carcinogenesis are dominated by the assumption that oncogenic mutations have defined advantageous fitness effects on recipient stem and progenitor cells, promoting and rate-limiting somatic evolution. However, this assumption is markedly discrepant with evolutionary theory, whereby fitness is a dynamic property of a phenotype imposed upon and widely modulated by environment. We computationally modeled dynamic microenvironment-dependent fitness alterations in hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) within the Sprengel-Liebig system known to govern evolution at the population level. Our model for the first time integrates real data on age-dependent dynamics of HSC division rates, pool size, and accumulation of genetic changes and demonstrates that somatic evolution is not rate-limited by the occurrence of mutations, but instead results from aged microenvironment-driven alterations in the selective/fitness value of previously accumulated genetic changes. Our results are also consistent with evolutionary models of aging and thus oppose both somatic mutation-centric paradigms of carcinogenesis and tissue functional decline. In total, we demonstrate that aging directly promotes HSC fitness decline and somatic evolution via non-cell-autonomous mechanisms.},

The framework of superstatistics allows one to formulate a maximum entropy principle with these generalized entropies, making them useful for understanding distribution functions of non-Markovian or nonergodic complex systems. For such systems where the composability axiom is violated there exist only two ways to implement the maximum entropy principle, one using escort probabilities, the other not. The two ways are connected through a duality. Here we show that this duality fixes a unique escort probability, which allows us to derive a complete theory of the generalized logarithms that naturally arise from the violation of this axiom. We then show how the functional forms of these generalized logarithms are related to the asymptotic scaling behavior of the entropy.},

	abstract = {Formalized rules for protein-protein interactions have recently been introduced to represent the binding and enzymatic activities of proteins in cellular signaling. Rules encode an understanding of how a system works in terms of the biomolecules in the system and their possible states and interactions. A set of rules can be as easy to read as a diagrammatic interaction map, but unlike most such maps, rules have precise interpretations. Rules can be processed to automatically generate a mathematical or computational model for a system, which enables explanatory and predictive insights into the system's behavior. Rules are independent units of a model specification that facilitate model revision. Instead of changing a large number of equations or lines of code, as may be required in the case of a conventional mathematical model, a protein interaction can be introduced or modified simply by adding or changing a single rule that represents the interaction of interest. Rules can be defined and visualized by using graphs, so no specialized training in mathematics or computer science is necessary to create models or to take advantage of the representational precision of rules. Rules can be encoded in a machine-readable format to enable electronic storage and exchange of models, as well as basic knowledge about protein-protein interactions. Here, we review the motivation for rule-based modeling; applications of the approach; and issues that arise in model specification, simulation, and testing. We also discuss rule visualization and exchange and the software available for rule-based modeling.},

These sequence-specific DNA binding proteins have been primarily characterized as transcription factors regulating diverse cellular processes from cell cycle control to developmental fate, deregulation of which contributes to developmental defects, cancer, and aging. We recently identified \textit{Saccharomyces cerevisiae} Forkhead 1 (Fkh1) and Forkhead 2 (Fkh2) as required for the clustering of a subset of replication origins in G$_{\textrm{1}}$ phase and for the early initiation of these origins in the ensuing S phase, suggesting a mechanistic role linking the spatial organization of the origins and their activity. Here, we show that Fkh1 and Fkh2 share a unique structural feature of human FoxP proteins that enables FoxP2 and FoxP3 to form domain-swapped dimers capable of bridging two DNA molecules in vitro. Accordingly, Fkh1 self-associates in vitro and in vivo in a manner dependent on the conserved domain-swapping region, strongly suggestive of homodimer formation. Fkh1- and Fkh2-domain-swap-minus (dsm) mutations are functional as transcription factors yet are defective in replication origin timing control. Fkh1-dsm binds replication origins in vivo but fails to cluster them, supporting the conclusion that Fkh1 and Fkh2 dimers perform a structural role in the spatial organization of chromosomal elements with functional importance.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

These models are the ordinary multinomial logit (MNL) model, a hierarchical model based on a set of nested MNL models, and an MNL model with a prior that introduces correlations between the parameters for classes that are nearby in the hierarchy.

For a nominal familywise error rate of 5\%, the parametric statistical methods are shown to be conservative for voxelwise inference and invalid for clusterwise inference. Our results suggest that the principal cause of the invalid cluster inferences is spatial autocorrelation functions that do not follow the assumed Gaussian shape. By comparison, the nonparametric permutation test is found to produce nominal results for voxelwise as well as clusterwise inference. These findings speak to the need of validating the statistical methods being used in the field of neuroimaging.},

	abstract = {It is not clear how biological pathways evolve to mediate a certain physiological response and why they show a level of complexity that is generally above the minimum required to achieve such a response. One possibility is that pathway complexity increases due to the nature of evolutionary mechanisms. Here, we analyze this possibility by using mathematical models of biological pathways and evolutionary simulations. Starting with a population of small pathways of three proteins, we let the population evolve with mutations that affect pathway structure through duplication or deletion of existing proteins, deletion or creation of interactions among them, or addition of new proteins. Our simulations show that such mutational events, coupled with a selective pressure, leads to growth of pathways. These results indicate that pathways could be driven toward complexity via simple evolutionary mechanisms and that complexity can arise without any specific selective pressure for it. Furthermore, we find that the level of complexity that pathways evolve toward depends on the selection criteria. In general, we find that final pathway size tends to be lower when pathways evolve under stringent selection criteria. This leads to the counterintuitive conclusion that simple response requirements on a pathway would facilitate its evolution toward higher complexity.},

	doi = {10.7554/eLife.31756},
	abstract = {Cells communicate with other cells via signaling molecules to coordinate their activities. Signals released from one cell can influence the behavior of neighboring cells. Signaling molecules belonging to the TGF-$\beta$ family play crucial roles in animals. For example, these molecules guide the formation of tissues and organs and help maintain them throughout the animal’s adult life. Abnormal regulation of TGF-$\beta$ family signaling can fuel the growth of cancer cells and also contribute to other diseases in humans. Molecules in the TGF-$\beta$ family bind to and bring together specific receptors on the surface of the receiving cell. This allows the receptors to activate so-called SMAD proteins within that cell. Activated SMADs move to the cell’s nucleus, where they regulate the activity of target genes. This in turn changes how the cell behaves. The best-studied member of the TGF-$\beta$ family is TGF-$\beta$ itself. It is well known to activate two particular SMAD proteins called SMAD2 and SMAD3. Recent research showed that TGF-$\beta$ could also activate two different SMAD proteins, SMAD1 and SMAD5. However, it was not understood how this was achieved, or what its biological consequences were. Ramachandran et al. set out to address these questions in mouse and human cells grown in the laboratory. The experiments showed that, in addition to its known dedicated receptors, TGF-$\beta$ also requires a third receptor to activate SMAD1 and SMAD5. Also, TGF-$\beta$ signaling leads to changes in the activity of several thousand genes, and approximately a quarter of them require signaling via SMAD1 and SMAD5. Further work showed that SMAD1 and SMAD5 are needed for a process called epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. This is a normal part of animal development, and is also a common feature of cancer cells, allowing them to spread to distant parts of the body. Understanding of how TGF-$\beta$ signaling works in more detail may reveal new ways to target this pathway to treat diseases like cancer. The next step is to see how the signaling via SMAD1 and SMAD5 contributes to different aspects of cancer development.},

In this paper, we relax this assumption by separating the population into heterogeneous classes, such that individuals from different classes differ in their ability to punish for selfishness. We compare the effects of introducing heterogeneity this way across two population models, that each represents a different type of population: the infinite and well-mixed population describes the way workers of social insects such as ants are organized, while a spatially structured population is more related to the way social norms evolve and are maintained in a social network. We find that heterogeneity in the effectiveness of punishment by itself has little to no effect on whether or not altruistic behavior will stabilize in a population. In contrast, heterogeneity in the cost that individuals pay to punish for selfish behavior allows altruistic behavior to be maintained more easily. Fewer punishers are needed to deter selfish behavior, and the individuals that punish will mostly belong to the class that pays a lower cost to do so. This effect is amplified when individuals that pay a lower cost for punishing inflict a higher punishment. The two population models differ when individuals that pay a low cost for punishing also inflict a lower punishment. In this situation, altruistic behavior becomes harder to maintain in an infinite and well-mixed population. However, this effect does not occur when the population is spatially structured.},

The molecular mechanisms governing the emergence of DE are further examined by time course scRNA-seq experiments, employing two new statistical tools to identify stage-specific genes over time (SCPattern) and to reconstruct the differentiation trajectory from the pluripotent state through mesendoderm to DE (Wave-Crest). Importantly, presumptive DE cells can be detected during the transitory phase from Brachyury (T) + mesendoderm toward a CXCR4 + DE state. Novel regulators are identified within this time window and are functionally validated on a screening platform with a T-2A-EGFP knock-in reporter engineered by CRISPR/Cas9. Through loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments, we demonstrate that KLF8 plays a pivotal role modulating mesendoderm to DE differentiation. We report the analysis of 1776 cells by scRNA-seq covering distinct human embryonic stem cell-derived progenitor states. By reconstructing a differentiation trajectory at single-cell resolution, novel regulators of the mesendoderm transition to DE are elucidated and validated. Our strategy of combining single-cell analysis and genetic approaches can be applied to uncover novel regulators governing cell fate decisions in a variety of systems.},

	abstract = {The developmental path by which a fertilized egg gives rise to the cells of a multicellular organism is termed the cell lineage. In 1983, John Sulston and colleagues documented the invariant cell lineage of the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans as determined by visual observation. However, tracing cell lineage in nearly all other multicellular organisms is vastly more challenging. Contemporary methods rely on genetic markers or somatic mutations, but these approaches have limitations that preclude their application at the level of a whole, complex organism. \#\#\# RATIONALE For a technology to comprehensively trace cell lineages in a complex multicellular system, it must uniquely and incrementally mark cells and their descendants over many divisions and in a way that does not interfere with normal development. These unique marks must also accumulate irreversibly over time, allowing the reconstruction of lineage trees. Finally, the full set of marks must be read out from each of many single cells. We hypothesized that genome editing, which introduces diverse, irreversible edits in a highly programmable fashion, could be repurposed for cell lineage tracing in a way that realizes these characteristics. To this end, we developed a method termed genome editing of synthetic target arrays for lineage tracing (GESTALT). This method uses genome editing to generate a combinatorial diversity of mutations that accumulate over many cell divisions within a compact DNA barcode consisting of multiple clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 target sites. Lineage relationships can be readily queried by sequencing the edited barcodes and relating the patterns of edits observed. \#\#\# RESULTS We first developed this approach in cell culture, editing synthetic arrays of 9 to 12 CRISPR/Cas9 target sites to generate thousands of unique derivative barcodes. We show that edited barcodes can be read by targeted sequencing of either DNA or RNA. In addition, the rates and patterns of barcode editing are tunable and the diverse edits accumulate over successive divisions in a way that is informative of cell lineage. We then applied GESTALT to the zebrafish Danio rerio by injecting fertilized eggs with editing reagents that target a genomic barcode bearing 10 target sites. Across dozens of embryos, we demonstrate the accumulation of hundreds to thousands of uniquely edited barcodes per animal, from which lineage relationships can be inferred on the basis of shared mutations. In adult zebrafish, we evaluated the edited barcodes from {\textbackslash}textasciitilde200,000 cells and observed that the majority of cells in each organ are derived from a small number of progenitor cells. Furthermore, ancestral progenitors, inferred on the basis of shared mutations among subsets of cells, can contribute to different germ layers and organ systems. \#\#\# CONCLUSION Our proof-of-principle experiments show that combinatorial, cumulative genome editing of a compact barcode can be used to record lineage information in multicellular systems. Further optimization of GESTALT will enable mapping of the complete cell lineage in diverse organisms. This method could also be adapted to link cell lineage information to molecular profiles of the same cells. In the long term, we envision that rich, systematically generated maps of organismal development—wherein lineage, epigenetic, transcriptional, and positional information are concurrently captured at single-cell resolution—will advance our understanding of development in both healthy and disease states. More broadly, cumulative and combinatorial genome editing could stably record other types of biological information and history in living cells. ![Figure][1]{\textless}/img{\textgreater} GESTALT. ( Left ) A barcode of CRISPR/Cas9 target sites is progressively edited over many cell divisions. ( Right ) Edited barcode sequences are related to one another on the basis of shared mutations in order to reconstruct lineage trees. Multicellular systems develop from single cells through distinct lineages. However, current lineage-tracing approaches scale poorly to whole, complex organisms. Here, we use genome editing to progressively introduce and accumulate diverse mutations in a DNA barcode over multiple rounds of cell division. The barcode, an array of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 target sites, marks cells and enables the elucidation of lineage relationships via the patterns of mutations shared between cells. In cell culture and zebrafish, we show that rates and patterns of editing are tunable and that thousands of lineage-informative barcode alleles can be generated. By sampling hundreds of thousands of cells from individual zebrafish, we find that most cells in adult organs derive from relatively few embryonic progenitors. In future analyses, genome editing of synthetic target arrays for lineage tracing (GESTALT) can be used to generate large-scale maps of cell lineage in multicellular systems for normal development and disease.

While it has been argued that SCs divide asymmetrically, there is also evidence that SCs undergo symmetric division. Symmetric SC division has been speculated to be key for expanding cell numbers in development and regeneration after injury. However, it might lead to uncontrolled growth and malignancies such as cancer. In order to explore the role of symmetric SC division, we propose a mathematical model of the effect of symmetric SC division on the robustness of a population regulated by a serial differentiation cascade and we show that this may lead to extinction of such population. We examine how the extinction likelihood depends on defining characteristics of the population such as the number of intermediate cell compartments. We show that longer differentiation cascades are more prone to extinction than systems with less intermediate compartments. Furthermore, we have analysed the possibility of mixed symmetric and asymmetric cell division against invasions by mutant invaders in order to find optimal architecture. Our results show that more robust populations are those with unfrequent symmetric behaviour.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Bayesian methods are advantageous for biological modelling studies due to their ability to quantify and characterize posterior variability in model parameters. When Bayesian methods cannot be applied, due either to non-determinism in the model or limitations on system observability, approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) methods can be used to similar effect, despite producing inflated estimates of the true posterior variance. Owing to generally differing application domains, there are few studies comparing Bayesian and ABC methods, and thus there is little understanding of the properties and magnitude of this uncertainty inflation. To address this problem, we present two popular strategies for ABC sampling that we have adapted to perform exact Bayesian inference, and compare them on several model problems. We find that one sampler was impractical for exact inference due to its sensitivity to a key normalizing constant, and additionally highlight sensitivities of both samplers to various algorithmic parameters and model conditions. We conclude with a study of the O9Hara–Rudy cardiac action potential model to quantify the uncertainty amplification resulting from employing ABC using a set of clinically relevant biomarkers. We hope that this work serves to guide the implementation and comparative assessment of Bayesian and ABC sampling techniques in biological models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The analysis of methylation patterns is a promising approach to investigate the genealogy of cell populations in an organism. In a stem cell-niche scenario, sampled methylation patterns are the stochastic outcome of a complex interplay between niche structural features such as the number of stem cells within a niche and the niche succession time, the methylation/demethylation process, and the randomness due to sampling. As a consequence, methylation pattern studies can reveal niche characteristics but also require appropriate statistical methods. The analysis of methylation patterns sampled from colon crypts is a prototype of such a study. Previous analyses were based on forward simulation of the cell content of the whole crypt and subsequent comparisons between simulated and experimental data using a few statistics as a proxy to summarize the data. In this paper we develop a more powerful method to analyze these data based on coalescent modelling and Bayesian inference. Results support a scenario where the colon crypt is maintained by a high number of stem cells; the posterior indicates a number greater than eight and the posterior mode is between 15 and 20. The results also provide further evidence for synergistic effects in the methylation/demethylation process that could for the first time be quantitatively assessed through their long-term consequences such as the coexistence of hypermethylated and hypomethylated patterns in the same colon crypt.},

	doi = {10.7554/eLife.30212},
	abstract = {When one child goes to school with a throat infection, many of his or her classmates will often start to come down with a sore throat after two or three days. A few of the children will get sick sooner, the very next day, while others may take about a week. As such, there is a distribution of incubation periods – the time from exposure to illness – across the children in the class. When plotted on a graph, the distribution of incubation periods is not the normal bell curve. Rather the curve looks lopsided, with a long tail on the right. Plotting the logarithms of the incubation periods, however, rather than the incubation periods themselves, does give a normal distribution. As such, statisticians refer to this kind of curve as a “lognormal distribution". Remarkably, many other, completely unrelated, diseases – like typhoid fever or bladder cancer – also have approximately lognormal distributions of incubation periods. This raised the question: why do such different diseases show such a similar curve? Working with a simple mathematical model in which chance plays a key role, Ottino-Löffler et al. calculate how long it takes for a bacterial infection or cancer cell to take over a network of healthy cells. The model explains why a lognormal-like distribution of incubation periods, modeled as takeover times, is so ubiquitous. It emerges from the random dynamics of the incubation process itself, as the disease-causing microbe or mutant cancer cell competes with the cells of the host. Intuitively, this new analysis builds on insights from the “coupon collector’s problem”: a classical problem in mathematics that describes the situation where a person collects items like baseball cards, stamps, or cartoon monsters in a videogame. If a random item arrives every day, and the collector’s luck is bad, they may have to wait a long time to collect those last few items. Similarly, in the model of Ottino-Löffler et al., the takeover time is dominated by dramatic slowdowns near the start or end of the infection process. These effects lead to an approximately lognormal distribution, with long waits, as seen in so many diseases. Ottino-Löffler et al. do not anticipate that their findings will have direct benefits for medicine or public health. Instead, they believe their results could help to advance basic research in the fields of epidemiology, evolutionary biology and cancer research. The findings might also make an impact outside biology. The term “contagion” has now become a familiar metaphor for the spread of everything from computer viruses to bank failures. This model sheds light on how long it takes for a contagion to take over a network, for a variety of idealized networks and spreading processes.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Increasing HIV testing rates among high-risk groups should lead to increased numbers of cases being detected. Coupled with effective treatment and behavioural change among individuals with detected infection, increased testing should also reduce onward incidence of HIV in the population. However, it can be difficult to predict the strengths of these effects and thus the overall impact of testing. We construct a mathematical model of an ongoing HIV epidemic in a population of gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men. The model incorporates different levels of infection risk, testing habits and awareness of HIV status among members of the population. We introduce a novel Bayesian analysis that is able to incorporate potentially unreliable sexual health survey data along with firm clinical diagnosis data. We parameterize the model using survey and diagnostic data drawn from a population of men in Vancouver, Canada. We predict that increasing testing frequency will yield a small-scale but long-term impact on the epidemic in terms of new infections averted, as well as a large short-term impact on numbers of detected cases. These effects are predicted to occur even when a testing intervention is short-lived. We show that a short-lived but intensive testing campaign can potentially produce many of the same benefits as a campaign that is less intensive but of longer duration.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Combining cell number measurements with a short-timescale dual pulse labelling method, we simultaneously determine the proliferation dynamics of primitive haematopoietic compartments and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). We observe an unchanging proportion of AML cells entering S phase per hour throughout disease progression, with substantial BM egress at high levels of infiltration. For healthy haematopoiesis, we find haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) make a significant contribution to cell production, but we phenotypically identify a quiescent subpopulation with enhanced engraftment ability. During AML progression, we observe that multipotent progenitors maintain a constant proportion entering S phase per hour, despite a dramatic decrease in the overall population size. Primitive populations are lost from BM with kinetics that are consistent with ousting irrespective of cell cycle state, with the exception of the quiescent HSC subpopulation, which is more resistant to elimination.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Single cell profiling methods are powerful tools for dissecting the molecular states of cells, but the destructive nature of these methods has made it difficult to measure single cell expression over time. When cell dynamics are asynchronous, they can form a continuous manifold in gene expression space whose structure is thought to encode the trajectory of a typical cell. This insight has spurred a proliferation of methods for single cell trajectory discovery that have successfully ordered cell states and identified differentiation branch-points. However, all attempts to infer dynamics from static snapshots of cell state face a common limitation: for any measured distribution of cells in high dimensional state space, there are multiple dynamics that could give rise to it, and by extension, multiple possibilities for underlying mechanisms of gene regulation. Here, we enumerate from first principles the aspects of gene expression dynamics that cannot be inferred from a static snapshot alone, but nonetheless have a profound influence on temporal ordering and fate probabilities of cells. On the basis of these unknowns, we identify assumptions necessary to constrain a unique solution for the dynamics and translate these constraints into a practical algorithmic approach, called Population Balance Analysis (PBA). At its core, PBA invokes a new method based on spectral graph theory for solving a certain class of high dimensional differential equation. We show the strengths and limitations of PBA using simulations and validate its accuracy on single cell profiles of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Altogether, these results provide a rigorous basis for dynamic interpretation of a gene expression continuum, and the pitfalls facing any method of dynamic inference. In doing so they clarify experimental designs to minimize these shortfalls.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The activity of adult stem cells is essential to replenish mature cells constantly lost due to normal tissue turnover. By a poorly understood mechanism, stem cells are maintained through self-renewal while concomitantly producing differentiated progeny. Here, we provide genetic evidence for an unexpected function of the c-Myc protein in the homeostasis of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Conditional elimination of c-Myc activity in the bone marrow (BM) results in severe cytopenia and accumulation of HSCs in situ. Mutant HSCs self-renew and accumulate due to their failure to initiate normal stem cell differentiation. Impaired differentiation of c-Myc-deficient HSCs is linked to their localization in the differentiation preventative BM niche environment, and correlates with up-regulation of N-cadherin and a number of adhesion receptors, suggesting that release of HSCs from the stem cell niche requires c-Myc activity. Accordingly, enforced c-Myc expression in HSCs represses N-cadherin and integrins leading to loss of self-renewal activity at the expense of differentiation. Endogenous c-Myc is differentially expressed and induced upon differentiation of long-term HSCs. Collectively, our data indicate that c-Myc controls the balance between stem cell self-renewal and differentiation, presumably by regulating the interaction between HSCs and their niche.},

	abstract = {Conformational clusters and consensus sequences for protein loops have been derived by computational analysis of their structures in a non-redundant set of 233 proteins with less than 25\% sequence homology (X-ray resolution better than 2.5 A). Loops have been classified into five types (alpha-alpha, beta-beta links, beta-beta hairpins, alpha-beta and beta-alpha) according to the secondary structures they embrace. Four variables have been used to describe the loop geometry, three angles and one distance between the secondary structure elements embracing the loop. Ramachandran angles (phi, psi) are used to define the loop conformations within each brace geometry. All loops from the non-redundant set have been clustered by means of these geometric features. A total of 56 classes (9 alpha-alpha, 11 beta-beta links, 14 beta-beta hairpins, 13 alpha-beta and 9 beta-alpha) were identified with consensus Ramachandran angles in the loops. These classes were divided into subclasses based on the brace geometry. This clustering procedure captures most of the clusters analysed by predominantly visual inspection methods and finds other clusters that have hitherto not been described. Consensus sequence patterns were identified for the subclasses. An extensive characterisation of loop conformations has therefore been achieved and the computational approach is readily open to the incorporation of information from newly determined structures. These clusters should also enhance model building by comparison studies.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Metastasis is a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality for many cancer patients and remains a major obstacle for effective treatment. In many tissue types, metastasis is fueled by the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)—a dynamic process characterized by phenotypic and morphologic changes concomitant with increased migratory and invasive potential. Recent experimental and theoretical evidence suggests that cells can be stably halted en route to EMT in a hybrid E/M phenotype. Cells in this phenotype tend to move collectively, forming clusters of circulating tumor cells that are key tumor-initiating agents. Here, we developed an inferential model built on the gene expression of multiple cancer subtypes to devise an EMT metric that characterizes the degree to which a given cell line exhibits hybrid E/M features. Our model identified drivers and fine-tuners of epithelial–mesenchymal plasticity and recapitulated the behavior observed in multiple \textit{in vitro} experiments across cancer types. We also predicted and experimentally validated the hybrid E/M status of certain cancer cell lines, including DU145 and A549. Finally, we demonstrated the relevance of predicted EMT scores to patient survival and observed that the role of the hybrid E/M phenotype in characterizing tumor aggressiveness is tissue and subtype specific. Our algorithm is a promising tool to quantify the EMT spectrum, to investigate the correlation of EMT score with cancer treatment response and survival, and to provide an important metric for systematic clinical risk stratification and treatment. \textit{Cancer Res; 77(22); 6415–28. ©2017 AACR}.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

There is now a deeper understanding of how competitive interactions influence community structure, for instance, how the shape of competition kernels can determine the clustering of species' traits. Competition is typically weaker for greater phenotypic difference, and the shape of the dependence defines a competition kernel. The clustering tendencies of kernels interact with other effects, such as variation in resource availability along a niche axis, but the kernel shape can have a decisive influence on community structure.

	abstract = {Normal tissues are organized hierarchically with a small number of stem cells, able to self-renew and give rise to all the differentiated cells found in the respective specialized tissues. The undifferentiated, multipotent state of normal stem cells is codetermined by the constituents of a specific anatomical space that hosts the normal stem cell population, called the "stem cell niche." Radiation interferes not only with the stem cell population but also with the stem cell niche, thus modulating a complex regulatory network. There is now mounting experimental evidence that many solid cancers share this hierarchical organization with their tissue of origin, with the cancer stem cells also occupying specialized niches. In this review, we highlight some of the best-characterized aspects of normal tissue stem cells, cancer stem cells, and their niches in the bone marrow, gut, and brain, as well as their responses to ionizing radiation.},

	abstract = {In this paper we use a hybrid multiscale mathematical model that incorporates both individual cell behaviour through the cell-cycle and the effects of the changing microenvironment through oxygen dynamics to study the multiple effects of radiation therapy. The oxygenation status of the cells is considered as one of the important prognostic markers for determining radiation therapy, as hypoxic cells are less radiosensitive. Another factor that critically affects radiation sensitivity is cell-cycle regulation. The effects of radiation therapy are included in the model using a modified linear quadratic model for the radiation damage, incorporating the effects of hypoxia and cell-cycle in determining the cell-cycle phase-specific radiosensitivity. Furthermore, after irradiation, an individual cell's cell-cycle dynamics are intrinsically modified through the activation of pathways responsible for repair mechanisms, often resulting in a delay/arrest in the cell-cycle. The model is then used to study various combinations of multiple doses of cell-cycle dependent chemotherapies and radiation therapy, as radiation may work better by the partial synchronisation of cells in the most radiosensitive phase of the cell-cycle. Moreover, using this multi-scale model, we investigate the optimum sequencing and scheduling of these multi-modality treatments, and the impact of internal and external heterogeneity on the spatio-temporal patterning of the distribution of tumour cells and their response to different treatment schedules.},

This model yields insight into several dynamical features, including multistep regulation and switchlike activation for several osmosensitive genes. Furthermore, the model correctly predicts the transcriptional dynamics of cells in response to different environmental and genetic perturbations.

	abstract = {In microorganisms, noise in gene expression gives rise to cell-to-cell variability in protein concentrations. In mammalian cells, protein levels also vary and individual cells differ widely in their responsiveness to uniform physiological stimuli. In the case of apoptosis mediated by TRAIL (tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) it is common for some cells in a clonal population to die while others survive-a striking divergence in cell fate. Among cells that die, the time between TRAIL exposure and caspase activation is highly variable. Here we image sister cells expressing reporters of caspase activation and mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization after exposure to TRAIL. We show that naturally occurring differences in the levels or states of proteins regulating receptor-mediated apoptosis are the primary causes of cell-to-cell variability in the timing and probability of death in human cell lines. Protein state is transmitted from mother to daughter, giving rise to transient heritability in fate, but protein synthesis promotes rapid divergence so that sister cells soon become no more similar to each other than pairs of cells chosen at random. Our results have implications for understanding 'fractional killing' of tumour cells after exposure to chemotherapy, and for variability in mammalian signal transduction in general.},

	abstract = {Abstract Recent studies have highlighted the importance of assessing the robustness of putative biomarkers identified from experimental data. This has given rise to the concept of stable biomarkers, which are ones that are consistently identified regardless of small perturbations to the data. Since stability is not by itself a useful objective, we present a number of strategies that combine assessments of stability and predictive performance in order to identify biomarkers that are both robust and diagnostically useful. Moreover, by wrapping these strategies around logistic regression classifiers regularized by the elastic net penalty, we are able to assess the effects of correlations between biomarkers upon their perceived stability. We use a synthetic example to illustrate the properties of our proposed strategies. In this example, we find that: (i) assessments of stability can help to reduce the number of false-positive biomarkers, although potentially at the cost of missing some true positives; (ii) combining assessments of stability with assessments of predictive performance can improve the true positive rate; and (iii) correlations between biomarkers can have adverse effects on their stability and hence must be carefully taken into account when undertaking biomarker discovery. We then apply our strategies in a proteomics context to identify a number of robust candidate biomarkers for the human disease HTLV1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP).},

Here, we introduce LipiDex, a freely available software suite that unifies and automates all stages of lipid identification, reducing hands-on processing time from hours to minutes for even the most expansive datasets. LipiDex utilizes flexible \textit{in silico} fragmentation templates and lipid-optimized MS/MS spectral matching routines to confidently identify and track hundreds of lipid species and unknown compounds from diverse sample matrices. Unique spectral and chromatographic peak purity algorithms accurately quantify co-isolation and co-elution of isobaric lipids, generating identifications that match the structural resolution afforded by the LC-MS/MS experiment. During final data filtering, ionization artifacts are removed to significantly reduce dataset redundancy. LipiDex interfaces with several LC-MS/MS software packages, enabling robust lipid identification to be readily incorporated into pre-existing data workflows.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) induces bone marrow (BM) failure in patients, predisposing them to life-threatening infections and bleeding. The mechanism by which AML mediates this complica- tion is unknown but one widely accepted explanation is that AML depletes the BM of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) through displacement. We sought to investigate how AML affects hema- topoiesis by quantifying residual normal hematopoietic subpopu- lations in the BM of immunodeficient mice transplanted with human AML cells with a range of genetic lesions. The numbers of normal mouse HSCs were preserved whereas normal progenitors and other downstream hematopoietic cells were reduced follow- ing transplantation of primary AMLs, findings consistent with a differentiation block at the HSC–progenitor transition, rather than displacement. Once removed from the leukemic environ- ment, residual normal hematopoietic cells differentiated normally and outcompeted steady-state hematopoietic cells, indicating that this effect is reversible. We confirmed the clinical significance of this by ex vivo analysis of normal hematopoietic subpopulations from BM of 16 patients with AML. This analysis demonstrated that the numbers of normal CD34+CD38{\textbackslash}textminus stem-progenitor cells were similar in the BM of AML patients and controls, whereas normal CD34+CD38+ progenitors were reduced. Residual normal CD34+ cells from patients with AML were enriched in long-term culture, initiating cells and repopulating cells compared with controls. In conclusion the data do not support the idea that BM failure in AML is due to HSC depletion. Rather, AML inhibits production of down- stream hematopoietic cells by impeding differentiation at the HSC–progenitor transition.},

Wnt effects are highly context dependent, and varying effects of Wnt signaling on hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have been reported. We explored the impact of Wnt signaling in vivo, specifically in the context of the HSC niche by using an osteoblast-specific promoter driving expression of the paninhibitor of canonical Wnt signaling, Dickkopf1 (Dkk1). Here we report that Wnt signaling was markedly inhibited in HSCs and, unexpectedly given prior reports, reduction in HSC Wnt signaling resulted in reduced p21Cip1 expression, increased cell cycling, and a progressive decline in regenerative function after transplantation. This effect was microenvironment determined, but irreversible if the cells were transferred to a normal host. Wnt pathway activation in the niche is required to limit HSC proliferation and preserve the reconstituting function of endogenous hematopoietic stem cells.},

For example, hematopoietic stem cells generate all mature blood cells, including monocytes, which have long been thought to be the major source of tissue macrophages. Recently, however, major macrophage populations were found to be derived from embryonic progenitors and to renew independently of hematopoietic stem cells. This process may not require progenitors, as mature macrophages can proliferate in response to specific stimuli indefinitely and without transformation or loss of functional differentiation. These findings suggest that macrophages are mature differentiated cells that may have a self-renewal potential similar to that of stem cells.},

A Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach has been proposed (Marjoram et al. 2003), but it suffers from computational problems and poor mixing. We propose several methodological developments to overcome the shortcomings of this MCMC approach and hence realize substantial computational advances over standard ABC. The principal idea is to relax the tolerance within MCMC to permit good mixing, but retain a good approximation to the posterior by a combination of subsampling the output and regression adjustment. We also propose to use a partial least-squares (PLS) transformation to choose informative statistics. The accuracy of our approach is examined in the case of the divergence of two populations with and without migration. In that case, our ABC-MCMC approach needs considerably lower computation time to reach the same accuracy than conventional ABC. We then apply our method to a more complex case with the estimation of divergence times and migration rates between three African populations.},

All identified somatically acquired genetic lesions were backtracked to distinct MDS-SCs, establishing their distinct MDS-propagating function in vivo. In isolated del(5q)-MDS, acquisition of del(5q) preceded diverse recurrent driver mutations. Sequential analysis in del(5q)-MDS revealed genetic evolution in MDS-SCs and MDS-progenitors prior to leukemic transformation. These findings provide definitive evidence for rare human MDS-SCs in vivo, with extensive implications for the targeting of the cells required and sufficient for MDS-propagation.},

However, whether cell division in HSCs precedes differentiation is unclear. To this end, we used an HSC cell-tracing approach and Ki67RFP knock-in mice, in a non-conditioned transplantation model, to assess divisional history, cell cycle progression, and differentiation of adult HSCs. Our results reveal that HSCs are able to differentiate into restricted progenitors, especially common myeloid, megakaryocyte-erythroid and pre-megakaryocyte progenitors, without undergoing cell division and even before entering the S phase of the cell cycle. Additionally, the phenotype of the undivided but differentiated progenitors correlated with the expression of lineage-specific genes and loss of multipotency. Thus HSC fate decisions can be uncoupled from physical cell division. These results facilitate a better understanding of the mechanisms that control fate decisions in hematopoietic cells.},

Using dynamic in vivo confocal imaging, here we show that murine bone marrow contains unique anatomic regions defined by specialized endothelium. This vasculature expresses the adhesion molecule E-selectin and the chemoattractant stromal-cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) in discrete, discontinuous areas that influence the homing of a variety of tumour cell lines. Disruption of the interactions between SDF-1 and its receptor CXCR4 inhibits the homing of Nalm-6 cells (an acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cell line) to these vessels. Further studies revealed that circulating leukaemic cells can engraft around these vessels, suggesting that this molecularly distinct vasculature demarcates a microenvironment for early metastatic tumour spread in bone marrow. Finally, purified haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and lymphocytes also localize to the same microdomains, indicating that this vasculature might also function in benign states to demarcate specific portals for the entry of cells into the marrow space. Specialized vascular structures therefore appear to delineate a microenvironment with unique physiology that can be exploited by circulating malignant cells.},

These high-dimensional population snapshot techniques are complemented by low-dimensional time-resolved, microscopy-based monitoring methods. Both fronts of advance have exposed a rich heterogeneity of cell states within uniform cell populations in many biological contexts, producing a new kind of data that has triggered computational analysis methods for data visualization, dimensionality reduction, and cluster (subpopulation) identification. The next step is now to go beyond collecting data and correlating data points: to connect the dots, that is, to understand what actually underlies the identified data patterns. This entails interpreting the 'clouds of points' in state space as a manifestation of the underlying molecular regulatory network. In that way control of cell state dynamics can be formalized as a quasi-potential landscape, as first proposed by Waddington. We summarize key methods of data acquisition and computational analysis and explain the principles that link the single-cell resolution measurements to dynamical systems theory.},

These events are triggered by decisions made by individual cells about their fate, which are in turn controlled by gene and protein regulation processes. While these cell fate decisions are subject to stochasticity and are not reproducible at the single-cell level, they result in highly consistent, almost deterministic patterns at the level of the whole cell population. The question of how this macroscopic order arises from a disordered microscopic behaviour is still outstanding, and is reminiscent of problems in physical systems that are readily addressed by statistical mechanics. Here we review recent studies that are beginning to provide the data needed to address this question and discuss conceptual ideas that might be used in a theoretical understanding of cell fate decision processes, emphasizing the challenges that biology poses to the application of statistical mechanics approaches to developmental biology.},

Surprisal analysis of mRNA time course data from lung and pancreatic cancer cells stimulated to undergo TGF-$\beta$1-induced EMT identifies two phenotypes. Examination of the time course for these phenotypes reveals that EMT reprogramming is a multistep process characterized by initiation, maturation, and stabilization stages that correlate with changes in cell metabolism. Surprisal analysis characterizes the free energy time course of the expression levels throughout the transition in terms of two state variables. The landscape of the free energy changes during the EMT for the lung cancer cells shows a stable intermediate state. Existing data suggest this is the previously proposed maturation stage. Using a single-cell ATP assay, we demonstrate that the TGF-$\beta$1-induced EMT for lung cancer cells, particularly during the maturation stage, coincides with a metabolic shift resulting in increased cytosolic ATP levels. Surprisal analysis also characterizes the absolute expression levels of the mRNAs and thereby examines the homeostasis of the transcription system during EMT.},

	abstract = {Based on an extensive study of a dynamical systems model of the development of a cell society, a novel theory for stem cell differentiation and its regulation is proposed as the "chaos hypothesis". Two fundamental features of stem cell systems-stochastic differentiation of stem cells and the robustness of a system due to regulation of this differentiation-are found to be general properties of a system of interacting cells exhibiting chaotic intra-cellular reaction dynamics and cell division, whose presence does not depend on the detail of the model. It is found that stem cells differentiate into other cell types stochastically due to a dynamical instability caused by cell-cell interactions, in a manner described by the Isologous Diversification theory. This developmental process is shown to be stable not only with respect to molecular fluctuations but also with respect to the removal of cells. With this developmental process, the irreversible loss of multipotency accompanying the change from a stem cell to a differentiated cell is shown to be characterized by a decrease in the chemical diversity in the cell and of the complexity of the cellular dynamics. The relationship between the division speed and the loss of multipotency is also discussed. Using our model, some predictions that can be tested experimentally are made for a stem cell system.},

Of the mice, 93 showed a donor-derived contribution to the circulating white blood cells for at least 4 months in one of four distinct patterns. Serial transplantation experiments indicated that two of the patterns were associated with extensive self-renewal of the original cell transplanted. However, within 4 days in vitro, the repopulation patterns subsequently obtained in vivo shifted in a clone-specific fashion to those with less myeloid contribution. Thus, primitive hematopoietic cells can maintain distinct repopulation properties upon serial transplantation in vivo, although these properties can also alter rapidly in vitro.},

Here, we describe the heterogeneity of a B220+CD117intCD19{\textbackslash}textminusNK1.1{\textbackslash}textminus uncommitted hematopoietic progenitor having combined lymphoid and myeloid potential. Phenotypic and functional assays revealed four subpopulations within the progenitor with distinct lineage developmental potentials. Among them, the Ly6D+SiglecH{\textbackslash}textminusCD11c{\textbackslash}textminus fraction was lymphoid-restricted exhibiting strong B-cell potential, whereas the Ly6D{\textbackslash}textminusSiglecH{\textbackslash}textminusCD11c{\textbackslash}textminus fraction showed mixed lympho-myeloid potential. Single-cell RNA sequencing of these subsets revealed that the latter population comprised a mixture of cells with distinct lymphoid and myeloid transcriptional signatures and identified a subgroup as the potential precursor of Ly6D+SiglecH{\textbackslash}textminusCD11c{\textbackslash}textminus. Subsequent functional assays confirmed that B220+CD117intCD19{\textbackslash}textminusNK1.1{\textbackslash}textminus single cells are, with rare exceptions, not bipotent for lymphoid and myeloid lineages. A B-cell priming gradient was observed within the Ly6D+SiglecH{\textbackslash}textminusCD11c{\textbackslash}textminus subset and we propose a herein newly identified subgroup as the direct precursor of the first B-cell committed stage.

To test and further develop tools for lineage tree reconstruction, we need test datasets with known trees.

Most HSCs were found in contact with the cells expressing high amounts of CXCL12, which we have called CXCL12-abundant reticular (CAR) cells. CAR cells surrounded sinusoidal endothelial cells or were located near the endosteum.

	abstract = {This study was performed to determine the effects of feeding a fiber-rich fraction ofBrassicavegetables on the immune response through changes in enteric bacteria and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production in normal mice. The boiled-water-insoluble fraction ofBrassica rapaL. (nozawana), which consists mainly of dietary fiber, was chosen as a test material. A total of 31 male C57BL/6J mice were divided into two groups and housed in a specific-pathogen-free facility. The animals were fed either a control diet or the control diet plus the insolubleB. rapaL. fraction for 2 weeks and sacrificed to determine microbiological and SCFA profiles in lower-gut samples and immunological molecules. rRNA-based quantification indicated that the relative population ofBacteroideteswas markedly lower in the colon samples of the insolubleB. rapaL. fraction-fed group than that in the controls. Populations of theEubacterium rectalegroup andFaecalibacterium prausnitzii, both of which are representative butyrate-producing bacteria, doubled after 2 weeks of fraction intake, accompanying a marginal increase in the proportion of colonic butyrate. In addition, feeding with the fraction significantly increased levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) and tended to increase splenic regulatory T cell numbers but significantly reduced the population of cells expressing activation markers. We demonstrated that inclusion of the boiled-water-insoluble fraction ofB. rapaL. can alter the composition of the gut microbiota to decrease the numbers ofBacteroidetesand to increase the numbers of butyrate-producing bacteria, either of which may be involved in the observed shift in the production of splenic IL-10.},

During inflammation, haematopoietic dynamics are perturbed, but it is not known whether changes to the HSC-niche interaction occur as a result. We visualise HSCs directly in vivo, enabling detailed analysis of the 3D niche dynamics and migration patterns in murine bone marrow following Trichinella spiralis infection. Spatial statistical analysis of these HSC trajectories reveals two distinct modes of HSC behaviour: (i) a preference for revisiting previously explored space, and (ii) a preference for exploring new space. Whereas HSCs from control donors predominantly follow pattern (i), those from infected mice follow both. Using detailed computational analyses of cell migration tracks and life-history theory, we show that the increased motility of HSCs following infection can, perhaps counterintuitively, enable mice to cope better in deteriorating HSC-niche micro-environments following infection.},

	abstract = {The human brain is a tissue of vast complexity in terms of the cell types it comprises. Conventional approaches to classifying cell types in the human brain at single cell resolution have been limited to exploring relatively few markers and therefore have provided a limited molecular characterization of any given cell type. We used single cell RNA sequencing on 466 cells to capture the cellular complexity of the adult and fetal human brain at a whole transcriptome level. Healthy adult temporal lobe tissue was obtained during surgical procedures where otherwise normal tissue was removed to gain access to deeper hippocampal pathology in patients with medical refractory seizures. We were able to classify individual cells into all of the major neuronal, glial, and vascular cell types in the brain. We were able to divide neurons into individual communities and show that these communities preserve the categorization of interneuron subtypes that is typically observed with the use of classic interneuron markers. We then used single cell RNA sequencing on fetal human cortical neurons to identify genes that are differentially expressed between fetal and adult neurons and those genes that display an expression gradient that reflects the transition between replicating and quiescent fetal neuronal populations. Finally, we observed the expression of major histocompatibility complex type I genes in a subset of adult neurons, but not fetal neurons. The work presented here demonstrates the applicability of single cell RNA sequencing on the study of the adult human brain and constitutes a first step toward a comprehensive cellular atlas of the human brain.},

	abstract = {Modeling the properties and functions of DNA sequences is an important, but challenging task in the broad field of genomics. This task is particularly difficult for non-coding DNA, the vast majority of which is still poorly understood in terms of function. A powerful predictive model for the function of non-coding DNA can have enormous benefit for both basic science and translational research because over 98\% of the human genome is non-coding and 93\% of disease-associated variants lie in these regions. To address this need, we propose DanQ, a novel hybrid convolutional and bi-directional long short-term memory recurrent neural network framework for predicting non-coding function de novo from sequence. In the DanQ model, the convolution layer captures regulatory motifs, while the recurrent layer captures long-term dependencies between the motifs in order to learn a regulatory ‘grammar’ to improve predictions. DanQ improves considerably upon other models across several metrics. For some regulatory markers, DanQ can achieve over a 50\% relative improvement in the area under the precision-recall curve metric compared to related models.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: While the reconstruction of transcripts from a sample of RNA-Seq data is a computationally expensive and complicated task, the detection of splicing events from RNA-Seq data and a gene annotation is computationally feasible. The latter task, which is adequate for many transcriptome analyses, is usually achieved by aligning the reads to a reference genome, followed by comparing the alignments with a gene annotation, often implicitly represented by a graph: the splicing graph. Results: We present ASGAL (Alternative Splicing Graph ALigner): a tool for mapping RNA-Seq data to the splicing graph, with the main goal of detecting novel alternative splicing events. ASGAL receives in input the annotated transcripts of a gene and an RNA-Seq sample, and it computes (1) the spliced alignments of each read, and (2) a list of novel events with respect to the gene annotation. Conclusions: An experimental analysis shows that, by aligning reads directly to the splicing graph, ASGAL better predicts alternative splicing events when compared to tools requiring spliced alignments of the RNA-Seq data to a reference genome. To the best of our knowledge, ASGAL is the first tool that detects novel alternative splicing events by directly aligning reads to a splicing graph.

	abstract = {Just as complex electronic circuits are built from simple Boolean gates, diverse biological functions, including signal transduction, differentiation, and stress response, frequently use biochemical switches as a functional module. A relatively small number of such switches have been described in the literature, and these exhibit considerable diversity in chemical topology. We asked if biochemical switches are indeed rare and if there are common chemical motifs and family relationships among such switches. We performed a systematic exploration of chemical reaction space by generating all possible stoichiometrically valid chemical configurations up to 3 molecules and 6 reactions and up to 4 molecules and 3 reactions. We used Monte Carlo sampling of parameter space for each such configuration to generate specific models and checked each model for switching properties. We found nearly 4,500 reaction topologies, or about 10\% of our tested configurations, that demonstrate switching behavior. Commonly accepted topological features such as feedback were poor predictors of bistability, and we identified new reaction motifs that were likely to be found in switches. Furthermore, the discovered switches were related in that most of the larger configurations were derived from smaller ones by addition of one or more reactions. To explore even larger configurations, we developed two tools: the "bistabilizer," which converts almost-bistable systems into bistable ones, and frequent motif mining, which helps rank untested configurations. Both of these tools increased the coverage of our library of bistable systems. Thus, our systematic exploration of chemical reaction space has produced a valuable resource for investigating the key signaling motif of bistability.},

In other words, are there statistical metrics of the network that correlate with survival? Furthermore, if there are, can such signatures provide clues to selecting new therapeutic targets? From the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Cancer Pathway database we computed several conventional and some less conventional network statistics. In particular we found a correlation (R(2) = 0.7) between degree-entropy and 5-y survival based on the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database. This correlation suggests that cancers that have a more complex molecular pathway are more refractory than those with less complex molecular pathway. We also found potential new molecular targets for drugs by computing the betweenness-a statistical metric of the centrality of a node-for the molecular networks.},

We previously proposed that the timing of vertebrate neuronal differentiation is regulated by molecular oscillations of a transcriptional repressor, HES1, tuned by a post-transcriptional repressor, miR-9. Here, we computationally model the effects of intrinsic noise on the Hes1/miR-9 oscillator as a consequence of low molecular numbers of interacting species, determined experimentally. We report that increased stochasticity spreads the timing of differentiation in a population, such that initially equivalent cells differentiate over a period of time. Surprisingly, inherent stochasticity also increases the robustness of the progenitor state and lessens the impact of unequal, random distribution of molecules at cell division on the temporal spread of differentiation at the population level. This advantageous use of biological noise contrasts with the view that noise needs to be counteracted.},

The influence that one population of cells has over the other has been a matter of intense study since it was established that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) require support of stromal elements to engraft, self-renew, and progress towards lineage commitment. Within the stromal components, cells of the osteoblastic lineage have the ability to interact with HSCs, and it has been proposed that they could be one of the main cell types responsible for the generation and maintenance of hematopoietic niches. Possible molecular mechanisms involved in the interaction between osteoblastic and hematopoietic cells have been described. However, understanding the relative importance of each one of them, their production by defined cells, and their kinetics of appearance have been limited by the lack of in vivo models allowing the physical and/or temporal dissection of the components of the osteoblastic lineage. Here, we provide a summary of the evidence that have established the importance of osteoblasts in hematopoiesis, and we propose new experimental strategies that could help to define the nature of these interactions.},

In addition, through the reverse process (mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition), both normal and carcinoma cells revert to the epithelial phenotype to, respectively, differentiate into organs or form secondary tumors. The parallels in phenotypic plasticity in normal morphogenesis and cancer highlight the importance of studying the embryo to understand tumor progression and to aid in the design of improved therapeutic strategies.},

Reciprocal signaling between UB and CM induces nephrogenesis and UB branching. Although low nephron number is implicated in hypertension and renal disease, the mechanisms that determine nephron number are obscure. To test the importance of nephron progenitor cell number, we genetically ablated 40\% of these cells, asking whether this would limit kidney size and nephron number or whether compensatory mechanisms would allow the developing organ to recover. The reduction in CM cell number decreased the rate of branching, which in turn allowed the number of CM cells per UB tip to normalize, revealing a self-correction mechanism. However, the retarded UB branching impaired kidney growth, leaving a permanent nephron deficit. Thus, the number of fetal nephron progenitor cells is an important determinant of nephron endowment, largely via its effect on UB branching.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Two central features of polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemosensory movement behavior demand fundamental theoretical understanding. In uniform concentrations of chemoattractant, these cells exhibit a persistent random walk, with a characteristic "persistence time" between significant changes in direction. In chemoattractant concentration gradients, they demonstrate a biased random walk, with an "orientation bias" characterizing the fraction of cells moving up the gradient. A coherent picture of cell movement responses to chemoattractant requires that both the persistence time and the orientation bias be explained within a unifying framework. In this paper, we offer the possibility that "noise" in the cellular signal perception/response mechanism can simultaneously account for these two key phenomena. In particular, we develop a stochastic mathematical model for cell locomotion based on kinetic fluctuations in chemoattractant/receptor binding. This model can simulate cell paths similar to those observed experimentally, under conditions of uniform chemoattractant concentrations as well as chemoattractant concentration gradients. Furthermore, this model can quantitatively predict both cell persistence time and dependence of orientation bias on gradient size. Thus, the concept of signal "noise" can quantitatively unify the major characteristics of leukocyte random motility and chemotaxis. The same level of noise large enough to account for the observed frequency of turning in uniform environments is simultaneously small enough to allow for the observed degree of directional bias in gradients.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Ubiquitylation not only directs the targeted destruction of tagged proteins by the 26 S proteasome, but it also modulates protein activities, protein-protein interactions and subcellular localization. An understanding of the components involved in protein ubiquitylation (E1s, E2s and E3s) is essential to understand how specificity and regulation are conferred upon these pathways. Much of what we know about the catalytic mechanisms of protein ubiquitylation comes from structural studies of the proteins involved in this process. Indeed, structures of ubiquitin-activating enzymes (E1s) and ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) have provided insight into their mechanistic details. E3s (ubiquitin ligases) contain most of the substrate specificity and regulatory elements required for protein ubiquitylation. Although several E3 structures are available, the specific mechanistic role of E3s is still unclear. This review will discuss the different types of ubiquitin signals and how they are generated. Recent advances in the field of protein ubiquitylation will be examined, including the mechanisms of E1, E2 and E3. In particular, we discuss the complexity of molecular recognition required to impose selectivity on substrate selection and topology of poly-ubiquitin chains.},

But how ratios of lineage-determining transcription factors stabilize progenitor cells and resolve their indeterminacy to commit them to discrete, mutually exclusive fates remains unexplained. We used a simple model and experimental measurements to analyze the dynamics of a binary fate decision governed by a gene-circuit containing auto-stimulation and cross-inhibition, as embodied by the GATA1-PU.1 paradigm. This circuit generates stable attractors corresponding to erythroid and myelomonocytic fates, as well as an uncommitted metastable state characterized by coexpression of both regulators, explaining the phenomenon of "multilineage priming". GATA1 and PU.1 mRNA and transcriptome dynamics of differentiating progenitor cells confirm that commitment occurs in two stages, as suggested by the model: first, the progenitor state is destabilized in an almost symmetrical bifurcation event, resulting in a poised state at the boundary between the two lineage-specific attractors; second, the cell is driven to the respective, now accessible attractors. This minimal model captures fundamental features of binary cell fate decisions, uniting the concepts of stochastic (selective) and deterministic (instructive) regulation, and hence, may apply to a wider range of binary fate decision points.},

Adaptive responses to RAF/MEK inhibition occur on a timescale of hours to days, involve homeostatic responses that reactivate MAP kinase signaling and compensatory mitogenic pathways, and attenuate the anti-tumor effects of RAF/MEK inhibitors. We profile adaptive responses across a panel of melanoma cell lines using multiplex biochemical measurement, single-cell assays, and statistical modeling and show that adaptation involves at least six signaling cascades that act to reduce drug potency (IC50) and maximal effect (i.e., E max ≪ 1). Among these cascades, we identify a role for JNK/c-Jun signaling in vemurafenib adaptation and show that RAF and JNK inhibitors synergize in cell killing. This arises because JNK inhibition prevents a subset of cells in a cycling population from becoming quiescent upon vemurafenib treatment, thereby reducing drug E max.

State-of-the-art genomics technology has enabled the mapping of these large gene networks, yet it remains a tremendous challenge to elucidate their design principles and the regulatory mechanisms underlying their biological functions such as signal processing and decision-making. One of the key barriers is the absence of accurate kinetics for the regulatory interactions, especially from in vivo experiments. To this end, we have developed a new computational modeling method, Random Circuit Perturbation (RACIPE), to explore the dynamic behaviors of gene regulatory circuits without the requirement of detailed kinetic parameters. RACIPE takes a network topology as the input, and generates an unbiased ensemble of models with varying kinetic parameters. Each model is subjected to simulation, followed by statistical analysis for the ensemble. We tested RACIPE on several gene circuits, and found that the predicted gene expression patterns from all of the models converge to experimentally observed gene state clusters. We expect RACIPE to be a powerful method to identify the role of network topology in determining network operating principles.},

Nowadays, an experimental measure of transcription factor activities in vivo represents a challenge. Several methods have been developed to infer these activities from easily measurable quantities such as mRNA expression of target genes. A limitation of these methods is represented by the fact that they rely on very simple single-layer structures, typically consisting of one or more transcription factors regulating a number of target genes. RESULTS:We present a novel statistical inference methodology to reverse engineer the dynamics of transcription factors in hierarchical network motifs such as feed-forward loops. The approach we present is based on a continuous time representation of the system where the high-level master transcription factor is represented as a two state Markov jump process driving a system of differential equations. We solve the inference problem using an efficient variational approach and demonstrate our method on simulated data and two real datasets. The results on real data show that the predictions of our approach can capture biological behaviours in a more effective way than single-layer models of transcription, and can lead to novel biological insights.

Biomolecular oscillators, distinct in their parameter sets or distinct in their architecture, show different resilience with respect to such intrinsic perturbations. Assessing this resilience can be done by ensemble stochastic simulations. These are computationally costly and do not permit further insights into the mechanistic cause of the observed resilience. For reaction systems operating at a steady state, the linear noise approximation (LNA) can be used to determine the effect of molecular noise. Here we show that methods based on LNA fail for oscillatory systems and we propose an alternative ansatz. It yields an asymptotic expression for the phase diffusion coefficient of stochastic oscillators. Moreover, it allows us to single out the noise contribution of every reaction in an oscillatory system. We test the approach on the one-loop model of the Drosophila circadian clock.

This observation is consistent with the evolution of cooperation within species [5], and there is now an increasing emphasis on the importance of cooperation between different microbial species [4, 6]. We lack, however, a systematic test of the importance of mutually positive interactions between different species, which is vital for assessing the common- ness and importance of cooperative evolution in natural communities. Here, we study the extent of mutually positive interaction among bacterial strains isolated from a common aquatic environment. Using data collected from two inde- pendent experiments evaluating community productivity across diversity gradients, we show that (1) in pairwise species combinations, the great majority of interactions are net negative and (2) there is no evidence that strong higher-order positive effects arise when more than two species are mixed together. Our data do not exclude the possibility of positive effects in one direction where one species gains at the expense of another, i.e., predator- prey-like interactions. However, these do not constitute cooperation and our analysis suggests that the typical result of adaptation to other microbial species will be competitive, rather than cooperative, phenotypes.},

Although multiple studies have investigated the adipogenic stem and precursor cells that give rise to mature adipocytes3–14, our understanding of their in vivo origin and properties is incomplete2,15,16. This is partially due to the highly heterogeneous and unstructured nature of adipose tissue depots 17 , which has proven difficult to molecularly dissect using classical approaches such as fluorescence-activated cell sorting and Cre–lox lines based on candidate marker genes16,18. Here, using the resolving power of single-cell transcriptomics 19 in a mouse model, we reveal distinct subpopulations of adipose stem and precursor cells in the stromal vascular fraction of subcutaneous adipose tissue. We identify one of these subpopulations as CD142+ adipogenesis-regulatory cells, which can suppress adipocyte formation in vivo and in vitro in a paracrine manner. We show that adipogenesis-regulatory cells are refractory to adipogenesis and that they are functionally conserved in humans. Our findings point to a potentially critical role for adipogenesis-regulatory cells in modulating adipose tissue plasticity, which is linked to metabolic control, differential insulin sensitivity and type 2 diabetes.},

Theoretical models and palaeoclimatic data predict a grim future, with rapid shifts towards a desert state, with accelerated diversity losses and ecological collapses. These shifts are a consequence of the special nonlinearities resulting from ecological facilitation. Here, we investigate a simple model of semiarid ecosystems identifying the so-called ghost, which appears after a catastrophic transition from a vegetated to a desert state once a critical rate of soil degradation is overcome. The ghost involves a slowdown of transients towards the desert state, making the ecosystem seem stable even though vegetation extinction is inevitable. We use this model to show how to exploit the ecological ghosts to avoid collapse. Doing so involves the restoration of small fractions of desert areas with vegetation capable of maintaining a stable community once the catastrophic shift condition has been achieved. This intervention method is successfully tested under the presence of demographic stochastic fluctuations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Intestinal crypt fission is a homeostatic phenomenon, observable in healthy adult mucosa, but which also plays a pathological role as the main mode of growth of some intestinal polyps. Building on our previous individual based model for the small intestinal crypt and on in vitro cultured intestinal organoids, we here model crypt fission as a budding process based on fluid mechanics at the individual cell level and extrapolated predictions for growth of the intestinal epithelium. Budding was always observed in regions of organoids with abundant Paneth cells. Our data support a model in which buds are biomechanically initiated by single stem cells surrounded by Paneth cells which exhibit greater resistance to viscoelastic deformation, a hypothesis supported by atomic force measurements of single cells. Time intervals between consecutive budding events, as simulated by the model and observed in vitro, were 2.84 and 2.62 days, respectively. Predicted cell dynamics was unaffected within the original crypt which retained its full capability of providing cells to the epithelium throughout fission. Mitotic pressure in simulated primary crypts forced upward migration of buds, which simultaneously grew into new protruding crypts at a rate equal to 1.03 days{\textbackslash}textminus1 in simulations and 0.99 days{\textbackslash}textminus1 in cultured organoids. Simulated crypts reached their final size in 4.6 days, and required 6.2 days to migrate to the top of the primary crypt. The growth of the secondary crypt is independent of its migration along the original crypt. Assuming unrestricted crypt fission and multiple budding events, a maximal growth rate of the intestinal epithelium of 0.10 days{\textbackslash}textminus1 is predicted and thus approximately 22 days are required for a 10-fold increase of polyp size. These predictions are in agreement with the time reported to develop macroscopic adenomas in mice after loss of Apc in intestinal stem cells.},

I will then point out the distinction between forward and reverse modeling and focus thereafter on the former. Instead of going into mathematical technicalities about different varieties of models, I will focus on their logical structure, in terms of assumptions and conclusions. A model is a logical machine for deducing the latter from the former. If the model is correct, then, if you believe its assumptions, you must, as a matter of logic, also believe its conclusions. This leads to consideration of the assumptions underlying models. If these are based on fundamental physical laws, then it may be reasonable to treat the model as 'predictive', in the sense that it is not subject to falsification and we can rely on its conclusions. However, at the molecular level, models are more often derived from phenomenology and guesswork. In this case, the model is a test of its assumptions and must be falsifiable. I will discuss three models from this perspective, each of which yields biological insights, and this will lead to some guidelines for prospective model builders.},

	abstract = {Chronic inflammation is a serious risk factor for cancer; however, the routes from inflammation to cancer are poorly understood. On the basis of the processes implicated by frequently mutated genes associated with inflammation and cancer in three organs (stomach, colon, and liver) extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and Gene Ontology databases, we present a multiscale model of the long-term evolutionary dynamics leading from inflammation to tumorigenesis. The model incorporates cross-talk among interactions on several scales, including responses to DNA damage, gene mutation, cell-cycle behavior, population dynamics, inflammation, and metabolism-immune balance. Model simulations revealed two stages of inflammation-induced tumorigenesis: a precancerous state and tumorigenesis. The precancerous state was mainly caused by mutations in the cell proliferation pathway; the transition from the precancerous to tumorigenic states was induced by mutations in pathways associated with apoptosis, differentiation, and metabolism-immune balance. We identified opposing effects of inflammation on tumorigenesis. Mild inflammation removed cells with DNA damage through DNA damage-induced cell death, whereas severe inflammation accelerated accumulation of mutations and hence promoted tumorigenesis. These results provide insight into the evolutionary dynamics of inflammation-induced tumorigenesis and highlight the combinatorial effects of inflammation and metabolism-immune balance. This approach establishes methods for quantifying cancer risk, for the discovery of driver pathways in inflammation-induced tumorigenesis, and has direct relevance for early detection and prevention and development of new treatment regimes.Cancer Res; 77(22); 6429-41. ©2017 AACR.},

Here we discuss how social diversity, in several of its flavors, catalyzes cooperative behavior. From the diversity in the number of interactions an individual is involved to differences in the choice of role models and contributions, diversity is shown to significantly increase the chances of cooperation. Individual diversity leads to an overall population dynamics in which the underlying dilemma of cooperation is changed, benefiting the society as whole. In addition, we show how diversity in social contexts can arise from the individual capacity for organizing their social ties. As such, Human diversity, on a grand scale, may be instrumental in shaping us as the most sophisticated cooperative entities on this planet.},

In this paper, we summarize the current state of the art in generation and validation of MSMs and give some important new results.

	abstract = {The B-lymphocyte lineage is a leading system for analyzing gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that orchestrate distinct cell fate transitions. Upon antigen recognition, B cells can diversify their immunoglobulin (Ig) repertoire via somatic hypermutation (SHM) and/or class switch DNA recombination (CSR) before differentiating into antibody-secreting plasma cells. We construct a mathematical model for a GRN underlying this developmental dynamic. The intensity of signaling through the Ig receptor is shown to control the bimodal expression of a pivotal transcription factor, IRF-4, which dictates B cell fate outcomes. Computational modeling coupled with experimental analysis supports a model of ‘kinetic control’, in which B cell developmental trajectories pass through an obligate transient state of variable duration that promotes diversification of the antibody repertoire by SHM/CSR in direct response to antigens. More generally, this network motif could be used to translate a morphogen gradient into developmental inductive events of varying time, thereby enabling the specification of distinct cell fates. \#\#\# Synopsis The generation of a diverse set of pathogen-specific antibodies, with differing affinities and effector functions, by B lymphocytes is essential for efficient protection from many microorganisms. Antibody gene diversification in B cells is mediated by two molecular processes termed class-switch recombination and somatic hypermutation (CSR/SHM) (F1A). The former enables the generation of antibodies with the same antigen-binding specificity, but different effector domains, whereas the latter results in a repertoire of antibodies with a range of affinities for a given antigen containing the same effector domain. CSR/SHM occurs in antigen-activated B cells before their terminal differentiation into plasma cells. The transcription factor IRF-4 is required for CSR/SHM as well as plasma-cell differentiation, with its highest levels of expression being necessary for the latter. IRF-4 acts in the context of a network of regulators that include Blimp-1, Pax5, Bach2 and Bcl-6 (F1B). Despite extensive characterization of these individual factors, how the network responds to sensing of antigen by the B cell antigen receptor (BCR, antibody molecule expressed on cell surface) to regulate the extent of antibody gene diversification and plasma-cell differentiation remains to be addressed. To address this issue, we assemble a computational model. The model reveals two contrasting scenarios that can underlie B cell fate dynamics. In one case, the initial rate of IRF-4 production controls a binary cell fate choice that involves either going to the CSR/SHM state or to the plasma-cell state; the time spent in the CSR state is relatively insensitive to the initial rate of IRF-4 production (herein called ‘basic bistability’). In the other case, IRF-4 drives all cells through a transient CSR/SHM state, but the initial rate of IRF-4 production sets its duration (‘kinetic control’). Both scenarios predict that increasing the initial rate of IRF-4 production favors the generation of plasma cells at the expense of CSR/SHM, but they differ fundamentally with respect to the underlying gene expression patterns. To distinguish between these two scenarios experimentally, we utilize two different genetic models. The first involves the B1-8i transgenic mouse whose B cells express a rearranged V187.2 VDJ Ig heavy chain gene segment that is specific for the hapten nitrophenol (NP). The second is a newly developed mouse model that allows exogenous control of IRF-4 expression in naive primary B cells using a tet-inducible allele. Using these models, we show that (i) BCR signal strength sets the initial rate of IRF-4 accumulation and (ii) the concentration of IRF-4 is sensed by an incoherent gene regulatory network architecture to regulate the extent of CSR/SHM prior to plasma-cell differentiation. Our results are consistent with the ‘kinetic-control model’ in which the levels of BCR-induced IRF-4 expression control the duration of an obligate CSR/SHM state that enables B cell diversification before terminal differentiation into plasma cells. Evidence for the transient CSR/SHM state is corroborated by both patterns of gene expression and the presence of AID-dependent mutations in individual non-switched plasmablasts. Our results provide a molecular framework for understanding how B cells balance the competing demands for Ig CSR and SHM with the secretion of antibodies during humoral immune responses. The key feature of the network architecture that allows IRF-4 to coordinate the two competing states of gene expression in a temporal manner is that it simultaneously but asymmetrically activates both sides of a bistable mutual repression circuit. Because the two effects of the primary regulator antagonize each other, we describe the circuit as being based on an ‘incoherent’ regulatory motif. Other incoherent regulatory motifs in varied biological systems are also associated with the acquisition of transient cell states, and we consider how the kinetic-control mechanism proposed by us could more generally serve to translate developmental cues into elaborate morphogenetic patterns.

Critically, even a non-oscillatory deterministic system can produce cyclic trajectories when it is in a low copy number, stochastic regime. Common methods of finding parameter ranges for stochastically driven resonances, such as direct calculation, are cumbersome for any but the smallest networks. In this paper, we provide a systematic framework to efficiently determine the number of resonant modes and parameter ranges for stochastic oscillations relying on real root counting algorithms and graph theoretic methods. We argue that stochastic resonance is a network property by showing that resonant modes only depend on the squared Jacobian matrix \textit{J}$^{\textrm{2}}$, unlike deterministic oscillations which are determined by \textit{J}. By using graph theoretic tools, analysis of stochastic behaviour for larger interaction networks is simplified and stochastic dynamical systems with multiple resonant modes can be identified easily.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Quantitative computational models play an increasingly important role in modern biology. Such models typically involve many free parameters, and assigning their values is often a substantial obstacle to model development. Directly measuring in vivo biochemical parameters is difficult, and collectively fitting them to other experimental data often yields large parameter uncertainties. Nevertheless, in earlier work we showed in a growth-factor-signaling model that collective fitting could yield well-constrained predictions, even when it left individual parameters very poorly constrained. We also showed that the model had a "sloppy" spectrum of parameter sensitivities, with eigenvalues roughly evenly distributed over many decades. Here we use a collection of models from the literature to test whether such sloppy spectra are common in systems biology. Strikingly, we find that every model we examine has a sloppy spectrum of sensitivities. We also test several consequences of this sloppiness for building predictive models. In particular, sloppiness suggests that collective fits to even large amounts of ideal time-series data will often leave many parameters poorly constrained. Tests over our model collection are consistent with this suggestion. This difficulty with collective fits may seem to argue for direct parameter measurements, but sloppiness also implies that such measurements must be formidably precise and complete to usefully constrain many model predictions. We confirm this implication in our growth-factor-signaling model. Our results suggest that sloppy sensitivity spectra are universal in systems biology models. The prevalence of sloppiness highlights the power of collective fits and suggests that modelers should focus on predictions rather than on parameters.},

The method features a weighted ensemble of trajectories in configuration space with energy levels dictating the proper correspondence between "particles" and probability. Instead of waiting a very long time for an unlikely event to occur, the probability packets are split, and small packets of probability are allowed to diffuse almost immediately into regions of configuration space that are less likely to be sampled. The method has been applied to the Northrup and Erickson (1992) model of docking-type diffusion-limited reactions and yields reaction rate constants in agreement with those obtained by direct Brownian simulation, but at a fraction of the CPU time (10(-4) to 10(-3), depending on the model). Because the method is essentially a variant of standard Brownian dynamics algorithms, it is anticipated that weighted-ensemble Brownian dynamics, in conjunction with biophysical force models, can be applied to a large class of association reactions of interest to the biophysics community.},

	abstract = {Author Summary The bistable switch, a common regulatory sub-network, is found in many biological processes. It consists of cross-repressing components that generate a switch-like transition between two possible states. In developing tissues, bistable switches, created by cross-repressing transcriptional determinants, are often controlled by gradients of secreted signalling molecules—morphogens. These provide a mechanism to convert a morphogen gradient into stripes of gene expression that determine the arrangement of distinct cell types. Here we use mathematical models to analyse the temporal response of such a system. We find that the behaviour is highly dependent on the intrinsic fluctuations that result from the stochastic nature of gene expression. This noise has a marked effect on both patterning time and the location of the stripe boundary. One of the techniques we use, Minimum Action Path theory, identifies key features of the switch without computationally expensive calculations. The results reveal a noise driven switching wave that propels the stripe boundary away from the morphogen source to eventually settle, at steady state, further from the morphogen source than in the deterministic description. Together the analysis highlights the importance dynamics in patterning and demonstrates a set of mathematical tools for studying this problem.},

Information is mathematically defined in terms of the entropy; and the extent of information flowing across an information channel or signalling system is typically measured by the ‘mutual information’, or the reduction in the uncertainty about the output once the input signal is known. Here, we quantify how extrinsic and intrinsic noise affects the transmission of simple signals along simple motifs of molecular interaction networks. Even for very simple systems, the effects of the different sources of variability alone and in combination can give rise to bewildering complexity. In particular, extrinsic variability is apt to generate ‘apparent’ information that can, in extreme cases, mask the actual information that for a single system would flow between the different molecular components making up cellular signalling pathways. We show how this artificial inflation in apparent information arises and how the effects of different types of noise alone and in combination can be understood.},

	abstract = {Phenotypic cell-to-cell variability within clonal populations may be a manifestation of 'gene expression noise', or it may reflect stable phenotypic variants. Such 'non-genetic cell individuality' can arise from the slow fluctuations of protein levels in mammalian cells. These fluctuations produce persistent cell individuality, thereby rendering a clonal population heterogeneous. However, it remains unknown whether this heterogeneity may account for the stochasticity of cell fate decisions in stem cells. Here we show that in clonal populations of mouse haematopoietic progenitor cells, spontaneous 'outlier' cells with either extremely high or low expression levels of the stem cell marker Sca-1 (also known as Ly6a; ref. 9) reconstitute the parental distribution of Sca-1 but do so only after more than one week. This slow relaxation is described by a gaussian mixture model that incorporates noise-driven transitions between discrete subpopulations, suggesting hidden multi-stability within one cell type. Despite clonality, the Sca-1 outliers had distinct transcriptomes. Although their unique gene expression profiles eventually reverted to that of the median cells, revealing an attractor state, they lasted long enough to confer a greatly different proclivity for choosing either the erythroid or the myeloid lineage. Preference in lineage choice was associated with increased expression of lineage-specific transcription factors, such as a {\textgreater}200-fold increase in Gata1 (ref. 10) among the erythroid-prone cells, or a {\textgreater}15-fold increased PU.1 (Sfpi1) (ref. 11) expression among myeloid-prone cells. Thus, clonal heterogeneity of gene expression level is not due to independent noise in the expression of individual genes, but reflects metastable states of a slowly fluctuating transcriptome that is distinct in individual cells and may govern the reversible, stochastic priming of multipotent progenitor cells in cell fate decision.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Fusion oncogenes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) promote self-renewal from committed progenitors, thereby linking transformation and self-renewal pathways. Like most cancers, AML is a genetically and biologically heterogeneous disease, but it is unclear whether transformation results from common or overlapping genetic programs acting downstream of multiple mutations or by the engagement of unique genetic programs acting cooperatively downstream of individual mutations. This distinction is important, because the involvement of common programs would imply the existence of common molecular targets to treat AML, no matter which oncogenes are involved. Here we show that the ability to promote self-renewal is a generalized property of leukemia-associated oncogenes. Disparate oncogenes initiated overlapping transformation and self-renewal gene expression programs, the common elements of which were defined in established leukemic stem cells from an animal model as well as from a large cohort of patients with differing AML subtypes, where they strongly predicted pathobiological character. Notably, individual genes commonly activated in these programs could partially phenocopy the self-renewal function of leukemia-associated oncogenes in committed murine progenitors. Furthermore, they could generate AML following expression in murine bone marrow. In summary, our findings reveal the operation of common programs of self-renewal and transformation downstream of leukemia-associated oncogenes, suggesting that mechanistically common therapeutic approaches to AML are likely to be possible, regardless of the identity of the driver oncogene involved. \textit{Cancer Res; 71(12); 4117–29. ©2011 AACR}.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:High-throughput sequencing allows the detection and quantification of frequencies of somatic single nucleotide variants (SNV) in heterogeneous tumor cell populations. In some cases, the evolutionary history and population frequency of the subclonal lineages of tumor cells present in the sample can be reconstructed from these SNV frequency measurements. But automated methods to do this reconstruction are not available and the conditions under which reconstruction is possible have not been described. RESULTS:We describe the conditions under which the evolutionary history can be uniquely reconstructed from SNV frequencies from single or multiple samples from the tumor population and we introduce a new statistical model, PhyloSub, that infers the phylogeny and genotype of the major subclonal lineages represented in the population of cancer cells. It uses a Bayesian nonparametric prior over trees that groups SNVs into major subclonal lineages and automatically estimates the number of lineages and their ancestry. We sample from the joint posterior distribution over trees to identify evolutionary histories and cell population frequencies that have the highest probability of generating the observed SNV frequency data. When multiple phylogenies are consistent with a given set of SNV frequencies, PhyloSub represents the uncertainty in the tumor phylogeny using a "partial order plot". Experiments on a simulated dataset and two real datasets comprising tumor samples from acute myeloid leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients demonstrate that PhyloSub can infer both linear (or chain) and branching lineages and its inferences are in good agreement with ground truth, where it is available. CONCLUSIONS:PhyloSub can be applied to frequencies of any "binary" somatic mutation, including SNVs as well as small insertions and deletions. The PhyloSub and partial order plot software is available from https://github.com/morrislab/phylosub/.},

In response to challenge with all-trans retinoic acid (atRA), the balance of daughter cell fate is unaltered, but the rate of cell division increases. However, after wounding, cells reversibly switch to producing an excess of proliferating daughters until the wound has closed. Such fate-switching enables a single progenitor population to both maintain and repair tissue without the need for a "reserve" slow-cycling stem cell pool.},

By using a near-complete 16-year pedigree of 12,579 winter-run steelhead (\textit{Oncorhynchus mykiss}) from the Hood River, Oregon, we examined the continued maintenance of two life history traits: the number of lifetime spawning events (semelparous vs. iteroparous) and age at first spawning (2–5 years). We found that repeat-spawning fish had more than 2.5 times the lifetime reproductive success of single-spawning fish. However, first-time repeat-spawning fish had significantly lower reproductive success than single-spawning fish of the same age, suggesting that repeat-spawning fish forego early reproduction to devote additional energy to continued survival. For single-spawning fish, we also found evidence for a fitness trade-off for age at spawning: older, larger males had higher reproductive success than younger, smaller males. For females, in contrast, we found that 3-year-old fish had the highest mean lifetime reproductive success despite the observation that 4- and 5-year-old fish were both longer and heavier. This phenomenon was explained by negative frequency-dependent selection: as 4- and 5-year-old fish decreased in frequency on the spawning grounds, their lifetime reproductive success became greater than that of the 3-year-old fish. Using a combination of mathematical and individual-based models parameterized with our empirical estimates, we demonstrate that both fitness trade-offs and negative frequency-dependent selection observed in the empirical data can theoretically maintain the diverse life history strategies found in this population.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

These processes mark the genome, such that a cancer's life history is encrypted in the somatic mutations present. We developed algorithms to decipher this narrative and applied them to 21 breast cancers. Mutational processes evolve across a cancer's lifespan, with many emerging late but contributing extensive genetic variation. Subclonal diversification is prominent, and most mutations are found in just a fraction of tumor cells. Every tumor has a dominant subclonal lineage, representing more than 50\% of tumor cells. Minimal expansion of these subclones occurs until many hundreds to thousands of mutations have accumulated, implying the existence of long-lived, quiescent cell lineages capable of substantial proliferation upon acquisition of enabling genomic changes. Expansion of the dominant subclone to an appreciable mass may therefore represent the final rate-limiting step in a breast cancer's development, triggering diagnosis.},

In particular, signalling pathways regulated by protein phosphorylation display features that facilitate a variety of responses to different biological inputs. The features that lead to multi-stationarity are of particular interest to determine, as well as the stability, properties of the steady states. In this paper, we determine conditions for the emergence of multi-stationarity in small motifs without feedback that repeatedly occur in signalling pathways. We derive an explicit mathematical relationship ϕ between the concentration of a chemical species at steady state and a conserved quantity of the system such as the total amount of substrate available. We show that ϕ determines the number of steady states and provides a necessary condition for a steady state to be stable-that is, to be biologically attainable. Further, we identify characteristics of the motifs that lead to multi-stationarity, and extend the view that multi-stationarity in signalling pathways arises from multi-site phosphorylation. Our approach relies on mass-action kinetics, and the conclusions are drawn in full generality without resorting to simulations or random generation of parameters. The approach is extensible to other systems.},

Recent studies in mice suggest that changes within the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) population during aging contribute significantly to the manifestation of these age-associated hematopoietic pathologies. Though the mouse HSC population has been shown to change both quantitatively and functionally with age, changes in the human HSC and progenitor cell populations during aging have been incompletely characterized. To elucidate the properties of an aged human hematopoietic system that may predispose to age-associated hematopoietic dysfunction, we evaluated immunophenotypic HSC and other hematopoietic progenitor populations from healthy, hematologically normal young and elderly human bone marrow samples. We found that aged immunophenotypic human HSC increase in frequency, are less quiescent, and exhibit myeloid-biased differentiation potential compared with young HSC. Gene expression profiling revealed that aged immunophenotypic human HSC transcriptionally up-regulate genes associated with cell cycle, myeloid lineage specification, and myeloid malignancies. These age-associated alterations in the frequency, developmental potential, and gene expression profile of human HSC are similar to those changes observed in mouse HSC, suggesting that hematopoietic aging is an evolutionarily conserved process.},

	abstract = {Cellular electrophysiology experiments, important for understanding cardiac arrhythmia mechanisms, are usually performed with channels expressed in non myocytes, or with non-human myocytes. Differences between cell types and species affect results. Thus, an accurate model for the undiseased human ventricular action potential (AP) which reproduces a broad range of physiological behaviors is needed. Such a model requires extensive experimental data, but essential elements have been unavailable. Here, we develop a human ventricular AP model using new undiseased human ventricular data: Ca(2+) versus voltage dependent inactivation of L-type Ca(2+) current (I(CaL)); kinetics for the transient outward, rapid delayed rectifier (I(Kr)), Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange (I(NaCa)), and inward rectifier currents; AP recordings at all physiological cycle lengths; and rate dependence and restitution of AP duration (APD) with and without a variety of specific channel blockers. Simulated APs reproduced the experimental AP morphology, APD rate dependence, and restitution. Using undiseased human mRNA and protein data, models for different transmural cell types were developed. Experiments for rate dependence of Ca(2+) (including peak and decay) and intracellular sodium ([Na(+)](i)) in undiseased human myocytes were quantitatively reproduced by the model. Early afterdepolarizations were induced by I(Kr) block during slow pacing, and AP and Ca(2+) alternans appeared at rates {\textgreater}200 bpm, as observed in the nonfailing human ventricle. Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK) modulated rate dependence of Ca(2+) cycling. I(NaCa) linked Ca(2+) alternation to AP alternans. CaMK suppression or SERCA upregulation eliminated alternans. Steady state APD rate dependence was caused primarily by changes in [Na(+)](i), via its modulation of the electrogenic Na(+)/K(+) ATPase current. At fast pacing rates, late Na(+) current and I(CaL) were also contributors. APD shortening during restitution was primarily dependent on reduced late Na(+) and I(CaL) currents due to inactivation at short diastolic intervals, with additional contribution from elevated I(Kr) due to incomplete deactivation.},

Here, we clarify that one of the interleukin (IL)-6/IL-12 family cytokines, IL-27, plays an important role in emergency myelopoiesis. Among various types of hematopoietic cells in bone marrow, IL-27 predominantly and continuously promoted expansion of only Lineage {\textbackslash}textminus Sca-1 + c-Kit + (LSK) cells, especially long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells, and differentiation into myeloid progenitors in synergy with stem cell factor. These progenitors expressed myeloid transcription factors such as Spi1 , Gfi1 , and Cebpa/b through activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 and 3, and had enhanced potential to differentiate into neutrophils, but not into plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Among various cytokines, IL-27 in synergy with stem cell factor had the strongest ability to augment the expansion of LSK cells and their differentiation into myeloid progenitors. The blood stage of malaria infection was revealed to enhance IL-27 expression through interferon-γ production, and IL-27 then promoted the expansion of LSK cells, differentiating and mobilizing them into the spleen, resulting in enhanced production of neutrophils to control the infection. Thus, IL-27 is one of the limited unique cytokines directly acting on hematopoietic stem cells to promote differentiation into myeloid progenitors during emergency myelopoiesis.},

	abstract = {During tissue and organ development and maintenance, the dynamic regulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation allows cells to build highly elaborate structures. The development of the vertebrate retina or the maintenance of adult intestinal crypts, for instance, involves the arrangement of newly created cells with different phenotypes, the proportions of which need to be tightly controlled. While some of the basic principles underlying these processes developing and maintaining these organs are known, much remains to be learnt from how cells encode the necessary information and use it to attain those complex but reproducible arrangements. Here, we review the current knowledge on the principles underlying cell population dynamics during tissue development and homeostasis. In particular, we discuss how stochastic fate assignment, cell division, feedback control and cellular transition states interact during organ and tissue development and maintenance in multicellular organisms. We propose a framework, involving the existence of a transition state in which cells are more susceptible to signals that can affect their gene expression state and influence their cell fate decisions. This framework, which also applies to systems much more amenable to quantitative analysis like differentiating embryonic stem cells, links gene expression programmes with cell population dynamics.

The idea that highly specialized 'microenvironmental' cues participate in the regulation of stem cells has evidence in classic embryology and more recently in adult stem cells through the use of model organisms. There is now ample evidence that an anatomically defined, specifically constituted place represents the niche for hematopoietic and other tissue-specific stem cells. This review provides a conceptual framework and detailed account of the hematopoietic stem cell niche as defined at present. The components are assembling into a more complex view of the niche and may now be amenable to examination as a system and possibly to alteration to affect outcomes in immune regeneration.},

Periodic chemotherapy administration can induce resonance within our model under high cell kill rate where the average cell cycle times may change during the course of treatment, and therapeutic benefits from these resonances cannot be solely based on cell cycle times in untreated tissue. The depletion rate under chemotherapy and the regrowth rate may differ between the cell populations, and our analysis suggests that this favors the tumour cells. We were able to distinguish between the effects of cycle-non-specific, S -phase-specific and M -phase-specific drugs, and found that these can show differences in sharpness and location of the resonance phenomenon.

	abstract = {Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is associated with the Philadelphia chromosome, which arises by a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 and harbors the BCR-ABL fusion oncogene. It is unknown whether any other mutations are needed for the chronic phase of the disease. The CML incidence increases as a function of age with an exponent of approximately 3. A slope of 3 could indicate that there are two mutations, in addition to the Philadelphia translocation, that have not yet been discovered. In this work, we explore an alternative hypothesis: We study a model of cancer initiation requiring only a single mutation. A mutated cell has a net reproductive advantage over normal cells and, therefore, might give rise to clonal expansion. The cancer is detected with a probability that is proportional to the size of the mutated cell clone. This model has three waiting times: (i) the time until a mutated cell is produced, (ii) the time of clonal expansion, and (iii) the time until the clone is detected. Surprisingly, this simple process can give rise to cancer incidence curves with exponents up to 3. Therefore, the CML incidence data are consistent with the hypothesis that the Philadelphia translocation alone is sufficient to cause chronic phase CML.},

Here, we show that ground-state ESCs express low Myc levels. Deletion of both c-myc and N-myc (dKO) or pharmacological inhibition of Myc activity strongly decreases transcription, splicing, and protein synthesis, leading to proliferation arrest. This process is reversible and occurs without affecting pluripotency, suggesting that Myc-depleted stem cells enter a state of dormancy similar to embryonic diapause. Indeed, c-Myc is depleted in diapaused blastocysts, and the differential expression signatures of dKO ESCs and diapaused epiblasts are remarkably similar. Following Myc inhibition, pre-implantation blastocysts enter biosynthetic dormancy but can progress through their normal developmental program after transfer into pseudo-pregnant recipients. Our study shows that Myc controls the biosynthetic machinery of stem cells without affecting their potency, thus regulating their entry and exit from the dormant state.},

CD34+ cells in leukemic mice declined in number over time and failed to mobilize into the peripheral circulation in response to cytokine stimulation. Neutralization of stem cell factor (SCF) secreted by leukemic cells inhibited CD34+ cell migration into malignant niches, normalized CD34+ cell numbers, and restored CD34+ cell mobilization in leukemic mice. These data suggest that the tumor microenvironment causes HPC dysfunction by usurping normal HPC niches and that therapeutic inhibition of HPC interaction with tumor niches may help maintain normal progenitor cell function in the setting of malignancy.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION:One of the challenging questions in modelling biological systems is to characterize the functional forms of the processes that control and orchestrate molecular and cellular phenotypes. Recently proposed methods for the analysis of metabolic pathways, for example, dynamic flux estimation, can only provide estimates of the underlying fluxes at discrete time points but fail to capture the complete temporal behaviour. To describe the dynamic variation of the fluxes, we additionally require the assumption of specific functional forms that can capture the temporal behaviour. However, it also remains unclear how to address the noise which might be present in experimentally measured metabolite concentrations. RESULTS:Here we propose a novel approach to modelling metabolic fluxes: derivative processes that are based on multiple-output Gaussian processes (MGPs), which are a flexible non-parametric Bayesian modelling technique. The main advantages that follow from MGPs approach include the natural non-parametric representation of the fluxes and ability to impute the missing data in between the measurements. Our derivative process approach allows us to model changes in metabolite derivative concentrations and to characterize the temporal behaviour of metabolic fluxes from time course data. Because the derivative of a Gaussian process is itself a Gaussian process, we can readily link metabolite concentrations to metabolic fluxes and vice versa. Here we discuss how this can be implemented in an MGP framework and illustrate its application to simple models, including nitrogen metabolism in Escherichia coli.

	abstract = {Relapse of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is thought to reflect the failure of current therapies to adequately target leukemia stem cells (LSCs), the rare, resistant cells presumed responsible for maintenance of the leukemia and typically enriched in the CD34+CD38{\textbackslash}textminus cell population. Despite the considerable research on LSCs over the past 2 decades, the clinical significance of these cells remains uncertain. However, if clinically relevant, it is expected that LSCs would be enriched in minimal residual disease and predictive of relapse. CD34+ subpopulations from AML patients were analyzed by flow cytometry throughout treatment. Sorted cell populations were analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization for leukemia-specific cytogenetic abnormalities (when present) and by transplantation into immunodeficient mice to determine self-renewal capacity. Intermediate (int) levels of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity reliably distinguished leukemic CD34+CD38{\textbackslash}textminus cells capable of engrafting immunodeficient mice from residual normal hematopoietic stem cells that exhibited relatively higher ALDH activity. Minimal residual disease detected during complete remission was enriched for the CD34+CD38{\textbackslash}textminusALDHint leukemic cells, and the presence of these cells after therapy highly correlated with subsequent clinical relapse. ALDH activity appears to distinguish normal from leukemic CD34+CD38{\textbackslash}textminus cells and identifies those AML cells associated with relapse.},

Here we explore an alternative explanation based on the hypothesis that markers are not perfect and are thus unable to identify all cancer stem cells. Our analysis is based on a mathematical model for cancer cell proliferation that takes into account phenotypic switching, imperfect markers and error in the sorting process. Our conclusion is that the observation of reversible expression of surface markers after sorting does not provide sufficient evidence in support of phenotypic switching.},

By generating mosaics with transgenes that simultaneously mark endothelial nuclei and membranes we are able to definitively identify and study the morphology and behavior of individual ECs during vessel sprouting and lumen formation. Using these methods, we show that developing trunk vessels are composed of ECs of varying morphology, and that single-cell analysis can be used to quantitate alterations in morphology and dynamics in ECs that are defective in proper guidance and patterning. Finally, we use single-cell analysis of intersegmental vessels undergoing lumen formation to demonstrate the coexistence of seamless transcellular lumens and single or multicellular enclosed lumens with autocellular or intercellular junctions, suggesting that heterogeneous mechanisms contribute to vascular lumen formation in vivo. The tools that we have developed for single EC analysis should facilitate further rigorous qualitative and quantitative analysis of EC morphology and behavior in vivo.},

	abstract = {Despite recent advances in single-cell genomic, transcriptional, and mass-cytometric profiling, it remains a challenge to collect highly multiplexed measurements of secreted proteins from single cells for comprehensive analysis of functional states. Herein, we combine spatial and spectral encoding with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microchambers for codetection of 42 immune effector proteins secreted from single cells, representing the highest multiplexing recorded to date for a single-cell secretion assay. Using this platform to profile differentiated macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the ligand of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), reveals previously unobserved deep functional heterogeneity and varying levels of pathogenic activation. Uniquely protein profiling on the same single cells before and after LPS stimulation identified a role for macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF) to potentiate the activation of LPS-induced cytokine production. Advanced clustering analysis identified functional subsets including quiescent, polyfunctional fully activated, partially activated populations with different cytokine profiles. This population architecture is conserved throughout the cell activation process and prevails as it is extended to other TLR ligands and to primary macrophages derived from a healthy donor. This work demonstrates that the phenotypically similar cell population still exhibits a large degree of intrinsic heterogeneity at the functional and cell behavior level. This technology enables full-spectrum dissection of immune functional states in response to pathogenic or environmental stimulation, and opens opportunities to quantify deep functional heterogeneity for more comprehensive and accurate immune monitoring.},

High-throughput technologies can provide a wealth of time-series data to better interrogate the complex regulatory dynamics inherent to organisms, but many network inference strategies do not effectively use temporal information. We address this limitation by introducing Sliding Window Inference for Network Generation (SWING), a generalized framework that incorporates multivariate Granger causality to infer network structure from time-series data. SWING moves beyond existing Granger methods by generating windowed models that simultaneously evaluate multiple upstream regulators at several potential time delays. We demonstrate that SWING elucidates network structure with greater accuracy in both in silico and experimentally validated in vitro systems. We estimate the apparent time delays present in each system and demonstrate that SWING infers time-delayed, gene–gene interactions that are distinct from baseline methods. By providing a temporal framework to infer the underlying directed network topology, SWING generates testable hypotheses for gene–gene influences.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Beta-catenin is the central signalling molecule of the canonical Wnt pathway, where it activates target genes in a complex with lymphoid enhancer factor/T-cell factor transcription factors in the nucleus. The regulation of beta-catenin activity is thought to occur via a cytoplasmatic multiprotein complex that includes the serine/threonine kinase glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) that phosphorylates beta-catenin, marking it for degradation by the proteasome. Here, we provide evidence showing that GSK-3beta has a nuclear function in downregulating the activity of beta-catenin. Using colorectal cell lines that express a mutant form of beta-catenin, which cannot be phosphorylated by GSK-3beta and ectopically expressed mutant beta-catenin protein, we show that nuclear GSK-3beta functions in a mechanism that does not involve beta-catenin phosphorylation to reduce the levels of Wnt signalling. We show that GSK-3beta enters the nucleus, forms a complex with beta-catenin and lowers the levels of beta-catenin/TCF-dependent transcription in a mechanism that involves GSK-3beta-Axin binding.},

	abstract = {Random matrix theory (RMT) has found applications throughout physics and applied mathematics, in subject areas as diverse as communications networks, population dynamics, neuroscience, and models of the banking system. Many of these analyses exploit elegant analytical results, particularly the circular law and its extensions. In order to apply these results, assumptions must be made about the distribution of matrix elements. Here we demonstrate that the choice of matrix distribution is crucial. In particular, adopting an unrealistic matrix distribution for the sake of analytical tractability is liable to lead to misleading conclusions. We focus on the application of RMT to the long-standing, and at times fractious, ‘diversity-stability debate’, which is concerned with establishing whether large complex systems are likely to be stable. Early work (and subsequent elaborations) brought RMT to bear on the debate by modelling the entries of a system’s Jacobian matrix as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables. These analyses were successful in yielding general results that were not tied to any specific system, but relied upon a restrictive i.i.d. assumption. Other studies took an opposing approach, seeking to elucidate general principles of stability through the analysis of specific systems. Here we develop a statistical framework that reconciles these two contrasting approaches. We use a range of illustrative dynamical systems examples to demonstrate that: (i) stability probability cannot be summarily deduced from any single property of the system (e.g. its diversity); and (ii) our assessment of stability depends on adequately capturing the details of the systems analysed. Failing to condition on the structure of dynamical systems will skew our analysis and can, even for very small systems, result in an unnecessarily pessimistic diagnosis of their stability.},

Large-scale scRNA-seq projects that generate data from different laboratories and at different times are rife with batch effects that can fatally compromise integration and interpretation of the data. In such cases, computational batch correction is critical for eliminating uninteresting technical factors and obtaining valid biological conclusions. However, existing methods assume that the composition of cell populations are either known or the same across batches. Here, we present a new strategy for batch correction based on the detection of mutual nearest neighbours in the high-dimensional expression space. Our approach does not rely on pre-defined or equal population compositions across batches, only requiring that a subset of the population be shared between batches. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing methods on a range of simulated and real scRNA-seq data sets. We also show how our method can be applied to integrate scRNA-seq data from two separate studies of early embryonic development.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have great potential for treating various diseases, especially those related to tissue damage involving immune reactions. Various studies have demonstrated that MSCs are strongly immunosuppressive in vitro and in vivo. Our recent studies have shown that un-stimulated MSCs are indeed incapable of immunosup- pression; they become potently immunosuppressive upon stimulation with the supernatant of activated lymphocytes, or with combinations of IFN-γ with TNF-α, IL-1α or IL-1$\beta$. This observation revealed that under certain circum- stances, inflammatory cytokines can actually become immunosuppressive. We showed that there is a species varia- tion in the mechanisms of MSC-mediated immunosuppression: immunosuppression by cytokine-primed mouse MSCs is mediated by nitric oxide (NO), whereas immunosuppression by cytokine-primed human MSCs is executed through indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO). Additionally, upon stimulation with the inflammatory cytokines, both mouse and human MSCs secrete several leukocyte chemokines that apparently serve to attract immune cells into the proximity with MSCs, where NO or IDO is predicted to be most active. Therefore, immunosuppression by inflam- matory cytokine-stimulated MSCs occurs via the concerted action of chemokines and immune-inhibitory NO or IDO produced by MSCs. Thus, our results provide novel information about the mechanisms of MSC-mediated immuno- suppression and for better application of MSCs in treating tissue injuries induced by immune responses.},

Understanding how cells respond to specific challenges, how these responses are contravened in diseased cells, and how to intervene pharmacologically in the decision-making processes of cells requires an accurate theory of the information-processing capabilities of macromolecular regulatory networks. Adopting an engineer's approach to control systems, we ask whether realistic cellular control networks can be decomposed into simple regulatory motifs that carry out specific functions in a cell. We show that such functional motifs exist and review the experimental evidence that they control cellular responses as expected.},

	abstract = {Collective cell migration is a fundamental process, occurring during embryogenesis and cancer metastasis. Neural crest cells exhibit such coordinated migration, where aberrant motion can lead to fatality or dysfunction of the embryo. Migration involves at least two complementary mechanisms: contact inhibition of locomotion (a repulsive interaction corresponding to a directional change of migration upon contact with a reciprocating cell), and co-attraction (a mutual chemoattraction mechanism). Here, we develop and employ a parameterized discrete element model of neural crest cells, to investigate how these mechanisms contribute to long-range directional migration during development. Motion is characterized using a coherence parameter and the time taken to reach, collectively, a target location. The simulated cell group is shown to switch from a diffusive to a persistent state as the response-rate to co-attraction is increased. Furthermore, the model predicts that when co-attraction is inhibited, neural crest cells can migrate into restrictive regions. Indeed, inhibition of co-attraction in vivo and in vitro leads to cell invasion into restrictive areas, confirming the prediction of the model. This suggests that the interplay between the complementary mechanisms may contribute to guidance of the neural crest. We conclude that directional migration is a system property and does not require action of external chemoattractants.},

	abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are characterized by their ability to execute a wide range of cell fate choices, including self-renewal, quiescence, and differentiation into the many different mature blood lineages. Cell fate decision making in HSCs, as indeed in other cell types, is driven by the interplay of external stimuli and intracellular regulatory programs. Given the pivotal nature of HSC decision making for both normal and aberrant hematopoiesis, substantial research efforts have been invested over the last few decades into deciphering some of the underlying mechanisms. Central to the intracellular decision making processes are transcription factor proteins and their interactions within gene regulatory networks. More than 50 transcription factors have been shown to affect the functionality of HSCs. However, much remains to be learned about the way in which individual factors are connected within wider regulatory networks, and how the topology of HSC regulatory networks might affect HSC function. Nevertheless, important progress has been made in recent years, and new emerging technologies suggest that the pace of progress is likely to accelerate. This review will introduce key concepts, provide an integrated view of selected recent studies, and conclude with an outlook on possible future directions for this field.},

	abstract = {The tumor suppressor gene RASSF1A is inactivated through point mutation or promoter hypermethylation in many human cancers. In this study, we conducted a Sleeping Beauty transposon-mediated insertional mutagenesis screen in Rassf1a-null mice to identify candidate genes that collaborate with loss of Rassf1a in tumorigenesis. We identified 10 genes, including the transcription factor Runx2, a transcriptional partner of Yes-associated protein (YAP1) that displays tumor suppressive activity through competing with the oncogenic TEA domain family of transcription factors (TEAD) for YAP1 association. While loss of RASSF1A promoted the formation of oncogenic YAP1-TEAD complexes, the combined loss of both RASSF1A and RUNX2 further increased YAP1-TEAD levels, showing that loss of RASSF1A, together with RUNX2, is consistent with the multistep model of tumorigenesis. Clinically, RUNX2 expression was frequently downregulated in various cancers, and reduced RUNX2 expression was associated with poor survival in patients with diffuse large B-cell or atypical Burkitt/Burkitt-like lymphomas. Interestingly, decreased expression levels of RASSF1 and RUNX2 were observed in both precursor T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and colorectal cancer, further supporting the hypothesis that dual regulation of YAP1-TEAD promotes oncogenic activity. Together, our findings provide evidence that loss of RASSF1A expression switches YAP1 from a tumor suppressor to an oncogene through regulating its association with transcription factors, thereby suggesting a novel mechanism for RASSF1A-mediated tumor suppression.},

However, particularly for nonlinear models, it is not obvious, either from inspection of the model or from the experimental data, that the inverse problem of parameter fitting will have a unique solution, or even a non-unique solution that constrains the parameters to lie within a plausible physiological range. Where parameters cannot be constrained they are termed ‘unidentifiable’. We focus on gaining insight into the causes of unidentifiability using inference-based methods, and compare a recently developed measure-theoretic approach to inverse sensitivity analysis to the popular Markov chain Monte Carlo and approximate Bayesian computation techniques for Bayesian inference. All three approaches map the uncertainty in quantities of interest in the output space to the probability of sets of parameters in the input space. The geometry of these sets demonstrates how unidentifiability can be caused by parameter compensation and provides an intuitive approach to inference-based experimental design.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We validate the predicted transitions across discrete states using flow cytometry.

Using the inferred discrete cell states to build a probabilistic model for the underlying gene regulatory network, we further predict and experimentally verify that these states have unique response to perturbations, thus defining them functionally.

A number of general principles have been established. The interactions at the level of cells are quite different from those among individual animals, therefore the study of collective motion of cells is likely to reveal some specific important features which we plan to overview in this paper. In addition to presenting the most appealing results from the quickly growing related literature we also deliver a critical discussion of the emerging picture and summarize our present understanding of collective motion at the cellular level. Collective motion of cells plays an essential role in a number of experimental and real-life situations. In most cases the coordinated motion is a helpful aspect of the given phenomenon and results in making a related process more efficient (e.g., embryogenesis or wound healing), while in the case of tumor cell invasion it appears to speed up the progression of the disease. In these mechanisms cells both have to be motile and adhere to one another, the adherence feature being the most specific to this sort of collective behavior. One of the central aims of this review is to present the related experimental observations and treat them in light of a few basic computational models so as to make an interpretation of the phenomena at a quantitative level as well.},

Cells can also undergo partial transitions to attain a hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) phenotype that has maximum cellular plasticity and allows migration of Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) as a cluster. Hence, deciphering the molecular players helping to maintain the hybrid E/M phenotype may inform anti-metastasis strategies. Here, we devised a mechanism-based mathematical model to couple the transcription factor OVOL with the core EMT regulatory network miR-200/ZEB that acts as a three-way switch between the E, E/M and M phenotypes. We show that OVOL can modulate cellular plasticity in multiple ways - restricting EMT, driving MET, expanding the existence of the hybrid E/M phenotype and turning both EMT and MET into two-step processes. Our theoretical framework explains the differences between the observed effects of OVOL in breast and prostate cancer, and provides a platform for investigating additional signals during metastasis.},

Here we demonstrate that murine tumor propagating cells (TPCs) with the markers Sca1 and CD24 are enriched for metastatic potential in orthotopic transplantation assays. CD24 knockdown decreased the metastatic potential of lung cancer cell lines resembling TPCs. In lung cancer patient data sets, metastatic spread and patient survival could be stratified with a murine lung TPC gene signature. The TPC signature was enriched for genes in the Hippo signaling pathway. Knockdown of the Hippo mediators Yap1 or Taz decreased in vitro cellular migration and transplantation of metastatic disease. Furthermore, constitutively active Yap was sufficient to drive lung tumor progression in vivo. These results demonstrate functional roles for two different pathways, CD24-dependent and Yap/Taz-dependent pathways, in lung tumor propagation and metastasis. This study demonstrates the utility of TPCs for identifying molecules contributing to metastatic lung cancer, potentially enabling the therapeutic targeting of this devastating disease.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Improved diagnostic tests for tuberculosis in children are needed. We hypothesized that transcriptional signatures of host blood could be used to distinguish tuberculosis from other diseases in African children who either were or were not infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). METHODS:The study population comprised prospective cohorts of children who were undergoing evaluation for suspected tuberculosis in South Africa (655 children), Malawi (701 children), and Kenya (1599 children). Patients were assigned to groups according to whether the diagnosis was culture-confirmed tuberculosis, culture-negative tuberculosis, diseases other than tuberculosis, or latent tuberculosis infection. Diagnostic signatures distinguishing tuberculosis from other diseases and from latent tuberculosis infection were identified from genomewide analysis of RNA expression in host blood. RESULTS:We identified a 51-transcript signature distinguishing tuberculosis from other diseases in the South African and Malawian children (the discovery cohort). In the Kenyan children (the validation cohort), a risk score based on the signature for tuberculosis and for diseases other than tuberculosis showed a sensitivity of 82.9\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 68.6 to 94.3) and a specificity of 83.6\% (95\% CI, 74.6 to 92.7) for the diagnosis of culture-confirmed tuberculosis. Among patients with cultures negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis who were treated for tuberculosis (those with highly probable, probable, or possible cases of tuberculosis), the estimated sensitivity was 62.5 to 82.3\%, 42.1 to 80.8\%, and 35.3 to 79.6\%, respectively, for different estimates of actual tuberculosis in the groups. In comparison, the sensitivity of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay for molecular detection of M. tuberculosis DNA in cases of culture-confirmed tuberculosis was 54.3\% (95\% CI, 37.1 to 68.6), and the sensitivity in highly probable, probable, or possible cases was an estimated 25.0 to 35.7\%, 5.3 to 13.3\%, and 0\%, respectively; the specificity of the assay was 100\%. CONCLUSIONS:RNA expression signatures provided data that helped distinguish tuberculosis from other diseases in African children with and those without HIV infection.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Hematopoiesis is a highly orchestrated developmental process that comprises various developmental stages of the hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). During development, the decision to leave the self-renewing state and selection of a differentiation pathway is regulated by a number of transcription factors. Among them, genes GATA-1 and PU.1 form a core negative feedback module to regulate the genetic switching between the cell fate choices of HSCs. Although extensive experimental studies have revealed the mechanisms to regulate the expression of these two genes, it is still unclear how this simple module regulates the genetic switching. METHODS:In this work we proposed a mathematical model to study the mechanisms of the GATA-PU.1 gene network in the determination of HSC differentiation pathways. We incorporated the mechanisms of GATA switch into the module, and developed a mathematical model that comprises three genes GATA-1, GATA-2 and PU.1. In addition, a novel multiple-objective optimization method was designed to infer unknown parameters in the proposed model by realizing different experimental observations. A stochastic model was also designed to describe the critical function of noise, due to the small copy numbers of molecular species, in determining the differentiation pathways. RESULTS:The proposed deterministic model has successfully realized three stable steady states representing the priming and different progenitor cells as well as genetic switching between the genetic states under various experimental conditions. Using different values of GATA-1 synthesis rate for the GATA-1 protein availability in the chromatin sites during the time period of GATA switch, stochastic simulations for the first time have realized different proportions of cells leading to different developmental pathways under various experimental conditions. CONCLUSIONS:Mathematical models provide testable predictions regarding the mechanisms and conditions for realizing different differentiation pathways of hematopoietic stem cells. This work represents the first attempt at using a discrete stochastic model to realize the decision of HSC differentiation pathways showing a multimodal distribution.},

This regularity is associated with a highly reproducible branching asymmetry that is consistent with locally operative growth mechanisms. We then develop a class of tip state models to represent elaboration of the ureteric tree and describe rules for ‘half-delay’ branching morphogenesis that describe almost perfectly the patterning of this structure. Spatial analysis suggests that the observed asymmetry may arise from mutual suppression of bifurcation, but not extension, between the growing ureteric tips, and demonstrates that disruption of patterning occurs in mouse mutants in which the distribution of tips on the surface of the kidney is altered. These findings demonstrate that kidney development occurs by way of a highly conserved reiterative pattern of asymmetric bifurcation that is governed by intrinsic and locally operative mechanisms.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {With the rising application of systems biology, sensitivity analysis methods have been widely applied to study the biological systems, including metabolic networks, signalling pathways and genetic circuits. Sensitivity analysis can provide valuable insights about how robust the biological responses are with respect to the changes of biological parameters and which model inputs are the key factors that affect the model outputs. In addition, sensitivity analysis is valuable for guiding experimental analysis, model reduction and parameter estimation. Local and global sensitivity analysis approaches are the two types of sensitivity analysis that are commonly applied in systems biology. Local sensitivity analysis is a classic method that studies the impact of small perturbations on the model outputs. On the other hand, global sensitivity analysis approaches have been applied to understand how the model outputs are affected by large variations of the model input parameters. In this review, the author introduces the basic concepts of sensitivity analysis approaches applied to systems biology models. Moreover, the author discusses the advantages and disadvantages of different sensitivity analysis methods, how to choose a proper sensitivity analysis approach, the available sensitivity analysis tools for systems biology models and the caveats in the interpretation of sensitivity analysis results.},

	abstract = {During mammalian ontogeny, haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) translocate from the fetal liver to the bone marrow, where haematopoiesis occurs throughout adulthood. Unique features of bone that contribute to a microenvironmental niche for stem cells might include the known high concentration of calcium ions at the HSC-enriched endosteal surface. Cells respond to extracellular ionic calcium concentrations through the seven-transmembrane-spanning calcium-sensing receptor (CaR), which we identified as being expressed on HSCs. Here we show that, through the CaR, the simple ionic mineral content of the niche may dictate the preferential localization of adult mammalian haematopoiesis in bone. Antenatal mice deficient in CaR had primitive haematopoietic cells in the circulation and spleen, whereas few were found in bone marrow. CaR-/- HSCs from fetal liver were normal in number, in proliferative and differentiative function, and in migration and homing to the bone marrow. Yet they were highly defective in localizing anatomically to the endosteal niche, behaviour that correlated with defective adhesion to the extracellular matrix protein, collagen I. CaR has a function in retaining HSCs in close physical proximity to the endosteal surface and the regulatory niche components associated with it.},

However, compared with intracellular signal transduction networks, the function and engineering principles of cell-to-cell communication networks are far less understood. Major complications include: cells are themselves regulated by complex intracellular signaling networks; individual cells are heterogeneous; and output of any one cell can recursively become an additional input signal to other cells. Here, we make use of a framework that treats intracellular signal transduction networks as "black boxes" with characterized input-to-output response relationships. We study simple cell-to-cell communication circuit motifs and find conditions that generate bimodal responses in time, as well as mechanisms for independently controlling synchronization and delay of cell-population responses. We apply our modeling approach to explain otherwise puzzling data on cytokine secretion onset times in T cells. Our approach can be used to predict communication network structure using experimentally accessible input-to-output measurements and without detailed knowledge of intermediate steps.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Owing to their tremendous diversity and plasticity, immune cells exert multifaceted functions in tumor-bearing hosts, ranging from anti-tumor to pro-tumor activities. Tumor immune landscapes differ greatly between and within cancer types. Emerging evidence suggests that genetic aberrations in cancer cells dictate the immune contexture of tumors. Here, we review the current understanding of the mechanisms whereby common drivers of tumorigenesis modulate the tumor immune milieu. We discuss these findings in the context of clinical observations and examine how cancer-cell-intrinsic properties can be exploited to maximize the benefit of immunomodulatory therapies. Understanding the relationship between cancer cell-intrinsic genetic events and the immune response may enable personalized immune intervention strategies for cancer patients.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

From the characterization of more than 6,000 proteins, 27,000 transcripts, and 15,000 differentially methylated regions (DMRs), we identified coordinated changes associated with early differentiation steps. DMRs show continuous gain or loss of methylation during differentiation, and the overall change in DNA methylation correlates inversely with gene expression at key loci. Our data reveal the differential expression landscape of 493 transcription factors and 682 lncRNAs and highlight specific expression clusters operating in HSCs. We also found an unexpectedly dynamic pattern of transcript isoform regulation, suggesting a critical regulatory role during HSC differentiation, and a cell cycle/DNA repair signature associated with multipotency in MPP2 cells.

We found that in mesenchyme-free conditions, the lung epithelium exerted a lateral inhibitory effect on the neighbouring epithelium via depletion of fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1). Contrary to previous suggestions, bone morphogenetic protein 4 could not substitute for the inhibitory effect. Based on of this observation, we used a reaction-diffusion model of the substrate-depletion type to represent the initial phase of in vitro branching morphogenesis of lung epithelium, with depletion of FGF playing the role of lateral inhibitor. The model was able to account for the effects of the FGF1 concentration, extracellular matrix degradation and different subtypes of FGF on morphogenesis of the lung bud epithelia. These results suggest that the depletion of FGF may be a key regulatory component in initial phase of branching morphogenesis of the lung bud epithelium in vitro.},

In principle, regulatory mechanisms can be inferred from single-cell observations of effector activity across time. However, rigorous inference techniques suitable for noisy, incomplete, and heterogeneous data are lacking. Here, we introduce stochastic inference on lineage trees (STILT), an algorithm capable of identifying stochastic models that accurately describe the quantitative behavior of cell fate markers observed using time-lapse microscopy data collected from proliferating cell populations. STILT performs exact Bayesian parameter inference and stochastic model selection using a particle-filter-based algorithm. We use STILT to investigate the autoregulation of Nanog, a heterogeneously expressed core pluripotency factor, in mouse embryonic stem cells. STILT rejects the possibility of positive Nanog autoregulation with high confidence; instead, model predictions indicate weak negative feedback. We use STILT for rational experimental design and validate model predictions using novel experimental data.

	abstract = {The alpha shape of a molecule is a geometrical representation that provides a unique surface decomposition and a means to filter atomic contacts. We used it to revisit and unify the definition and computation of surface residues, contiguous patches, and curvature. These descriptors are evaluated and compared with former approaches on 85 proteins for which both bound and unbound forms are available. Based on the local density of interactions, the detection of surface residues shows a sensibility of 98\%, whereas preserving a well-formed protein core. A novel conception of surface patch is defined by traveling along the surface from a central residue or atom. By construction, all surface patches are contiguous and, therefore, allows to cope with common problems of wrong and nonselection of neighbors. In the case of protein-binding site prediction, this new definition has improved the signal-to-noise ratio by 2.6 times compared with a widely used approach. With most common approaches, the computation of surface curvature can be locally biased by the presence of subsurface cavities and local variations of atomic densities. A novel notion of surface curvature is specifically developed to avoid such bias and is parametrizable to emphasize either local or global features. It defines a molecular landscape composed on average of 38\% knobs and 62\% clefts where interacting residues (IR) are 30\% more frequent in knobs. A statistical analysis shows that residues in knobs are more charged, less hydrophobic and less aromatic than residues in clefts. IR in knobs are, however, much more hydrophobic and aromatic and less charged than noninteracting residues (non-IR) in knobs. Furthermore, IR are shown to be more accessible than non-IR both in clefts and knobs. The use of the alpha shape as a unifying framework allows for formal definitions, and fast and robust computations desirable in large-scale projects. This swiftness is not achieved to the detriment of quality, as proven by valid improvements compared with former approaches. In addition, our approach is general enough to be applied on nucleic acids and any other biomolecules.},

	abstract = {With the advance of experimental techniques such as time-lapse fluorescence microscopy, the availability of single-cell trajectory data has vastly increased, and so has the demand for computational methods suitable for parameter inference with this type of data. Most of currently available methods treat single-cell trajectories independently, ignoring the mother-daughter relationships and the information provided by the population structure. However, this information is essential if a process of interest happens at cell division, or if it evolves slowly compared to the duration of the cell cycle. In this work, we propose a Bayesian framework for parameter inference on single-cell time-lapse data from lineage trees. Our method relies on a combination of Sequential Monte Carlo for approximating the parameter likelihood function and Markov Chain Monte Carlo for parameter exploration. We demonstrate our inference framework on two simple examples in which the lineage tree information is crucial: one in which the cell phenotype can only switch at cell division and another where the cell state fluctuates slowly over timescales that extend well beyond the cell-cycle duration. There exist several examples of biological processes, such as stem cell fate decisions or epigenetically controlled phase variation in bacteria, where the cell ancestry is expected to contain important information about the underlying system dynamics. Parameter inference methods that discard this information are expected to perform poorly for such type of processes. Our method provides a simple and computationally efficient way to take into account single-cell lineage tree data for the purpose of parameter inference and serves as a starting point for the development of more sophisticated and powerful approaches in the future.},

The distributive kinetic mechanism of two-site MAP kinase phosphorylation inherently generates a nonlinear switch-like response. However, a linear graded response of MAP kinase has also been observed in mammalian cells, and its molecular mechanism remains unclear. To dissect these input-output behaviors, we quantitatively measured the kinetic parameters involved in the MEK (MAPK/ERK kinase)-ERK MAP kinase signaling module in HeLa cells. Using a numerical analysis based on experimentally determined parameters, we predicted in silico and validated in vivo that ERK is processively phosphorylated in HeLa cells. Finally, we identified molecular crowding as a critical factor that converts distributive phosphorylation into processive phosphorylation. We proposed the term quasi-processive phosphorylation to describe this mode of ERK phosphorylation that is operated under the physiological condition of molecular crowding. The generality of this phenomenon may provide a new paradigm for a diverse set of biochemical reactions including multiple posttranslational modifications.},

Notch signaling is implicated in maintaining glioma stem-like cells (GSCs) within the hypoxic niche, although the molecular mechanisms linking hypoxia to Notch activation have not been clearly delineated. Here we show that Vasorin is a critical link between hypoxia and Notch signaling in GSCs. Vasorin is preferentially induced in GSCs by a HIF1α/STAT3 co-activator complex and stabilizes Notch1 protein at the cell membrane. This interaction prevents Numb from binding Notch1, rescuing it from Numb-mediated lysosomal degradation. Thus, Vasorin acts as a switch to augment Notch signaling under hypoxic conditions. Vasorin promotes tumor growth and reduces survival in mouse models of glioblastoma, and its expression correlates with increased aggression of human gliomas. These findings provide mechanistic insights into how hypoxia promotes Notch signaling in glioma and identify Vasorin as a potential therapeutic target.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Forward and backward transitions between epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes play crucial roles in embryonic development and tissue repair. Aberrantly regulated transitions are also a hallmark of cancer metastasis. The genetic network that regulates these transitions appears to allow for the existence of a hybrid phenotype (epithelial/mesenchymal). Hybrid cells are endowed with mixed epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics, enabling specialized capabilities such as collective cell migration. Cell-fate determination between the three phenotypes is in fact regulated by a circuit composed of two highly interconnected chimeric modules–the miR-34/SNAIL and the miR-200/ZEB mutual-inhibition feedback circuits. Here, we used detailed modeling of microRNA-based regulation to study this core unit. More specifically, we investigated the functions of the two isolated modules and subsequently of the combined unit when the two modules are integrated into the full regulatory circuit. We found that miR-200/ZEB forms a tristable circuit that acts as a ternary switch, driven by miR-34/SNAIL, that is a monostable module that acts as a noise-buffering integrator of internal and external signals. We propose to associate the three stable states–(1,0), (high miR-200)/(low ZEB); (0,1), (low miR-200)/(high ZEB); and (1/2,1/2), (medium miR-200)/(medium ZEB)–with the epithelial, mesenchymal, and hybrid phenotypes, respectively. Our (1/2,1/2) state hypothesis is consistent with recent experimental studies (e.g., ZEB expression measurements in collectively migrating cells) and explains the lack of observed mesenchymal-to-hybrid transitions in metastatic cells and in induced pluripotent stem cells. Testable predictions of dynamic gene expression during complete and partial transitions are presented.},

This induces erythroid lineage bias at all lineage bifurcations known to exist between hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and committed erythroid progenitors, leading to increased erythroid and decreased myeloid HSC output. Epo, therefore, has a lineage instructive role in vivo, through suppression of non-erythroid fate options, demonstrating the ability of a cytokine to systematically bias successive lineage choices in favor of the generation of a specific cell type.},

Combined with computer modeling, our results argue for a Turing-type mechanism underlying digit patterning, in which the dose of distal Hox genes modulates the digit period or wavelength.

Transcription factors typically engage in complex interaction networks, likely masking the effects of specifically inhibiting single protein-protein interactions. Here, we used a combination of genomic, proteomic and biophysical methods to discover a suite of protein-protein interactions involving the SOX18 transcription factor, a known regulator of vascular development and disease. We describe a small-molecule that is able to disrupt a discrete subset of SOX18-dependent interactions. This compound selectively suppressed SOX18 transcriptional outputs in vitro and interfered with vascular development in zebrafish larvae. In a mouse pre-clinical model of breast cancer, treatment with this inhibitor significantly improved survival by reducing tumour vascular density and metastatic spread. Our studies validate an interactome-based molecular strategy to interfere with transcription factor activity, for the development of novel disease therapeutics.},

Our previous work suggested that the B56 regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibits Wnt signaling. Okadaic acid (a phosphatase inhibitor) increases, while B56 expression reduces, beta-catenin abundance; B56 also reduces transcription of Wnt-responsive genes. Okadaic acid is a tumor promoter, and the structural A subunit of PP2A is mutated in multiple cancers. Taken together, the evidence suggests that PP2A is a tumor suppressor. However, other studies suggest that PP2A activates Wnt signaling. We now show that the B56, A and catalytic C subunits of PP2A each have ventralizing activity in Xenopus embryos. B56 was epistatically positioned downstream of GSK3beta and axin but upstream of beta-catenin, and axin co-immunoprecipitated B56, A and C subunits, suggesting that PP2A:B56 is in the beta-catenin degradation complex. PP2A appears to be essential for beta-catenin degradation, since beta-catenin degradation was reconstituted in phosphatase-depleted Xenopus egg extracts by PP2A, but not PP1. These results support the hypothesis that PP2A:B56 directly inhibits Wnt signaling and plays a role in development and carcinogenesis.},

Despite the biological simplicity of the models, we show how these can be used to understand the severity of the infection and the key attributes of possible immunotherapy and antiviral drugs for the treatment of infection at different times post infection. Through an analytic approach, we derive and estimate simple summary biological quantities that can provide novel insights into the infection dynamics and the definition of clinical endpoints. We focus on nine quantities, including the area under the viral load curve, peak viral load, the time to peak viral load and the level of cell death due to infection. Using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, we fitted the models to data collected from 12 untreated volunteers who participated in two clinical studies that tested the antiviral drugs oseltamivir and zanamivir. Based on the results, we also discuss various difficulties in deriving precise estimates of the parameters, even in the very simple models considered, when experimental data are limited to viral load measures and/or there is a limited number of viral load measurements post infection.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Bacteria have evolved a rich set of mechanisms for sensing and adapting to adverse conditions in their environment. These are crucial for their survival, which requires them to react to extracellular stresses such as heat shock, ethanol treatment or phage infection. Here we focus on studying the phage shock protein (Psp) stress response in Escherichia coli induced by a phage infection or other damage to the bacterial membrane. This system has not yet been theoretically modelled or analysed in silico. RESULTS:We develop a model of the Psp response system, and illustrate how such models can be constructed and analyzed in light of available sparse and qualitative information in order to generate novel biological hypotheses about their dynamical behaviour. We analyze this model using tools from Petri-net theory and study its dynamical range that is consistent with currently available knowledge by conditioning model parameters on the available data in an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) framework. Within this ABC approach we analyze stochastic and deterministic dynamics. This analysis allows us to identify different types of behaviour and these mechanistic insights can in turn be used to design new, more detailed and time-resolved experiments. CONCLUSIONS:We have developed the first mechanistic model of the Psp response in E. coli. This model allows us to predict the possible qualitative stochastic and deterministic dynamic behaviours of key molecular players in the stress response. Our inferential approach can be applied to stress response and signalling systems more generally: in the ABC framework we can condition mathematical models on qualitative data in order to delimit e.g. parameter ranges or the qualitative system dynamics in light of available end-point or qualitative information.},

Our model incorporates two distinct mechanisms: one is associated with recent decisions of users, and the other reflects the cumulative popularity of each application. Importantly, although various combinations of the two mechanisms yield long-time behavior that is consistent with data, the only models that reproduce the observed temporal dynamics are those that strongly emphasize the recent popularity of applications over their cumulative popularity. This demonstrates–even when using purely observational data without experimental design–that temporal data-driven modeling can effectively distinguish between competing microscopic mechanisms, allowing us to uncover previously unidentified aspects of collective online behavior.},

This variability is in contrast to conventional analyses of biological networks, which have overwhelmingly employed static graph models which stay constant over time to describe biological systems and their underlying molecular interactions. METHODS:To overcome these limitations, we propose here a new statistical modelling framework, the ARTIVA formalism (Auto Regressive TIme VArying models), and an associated inferential procedure that allows us to learn temporally varying gene-regulation networks from biological time-course expression data. ARTIVA simultaneously infers the topology of a regulatory network and how it changes over time. It allows us to recover the chronology of regulatory associations for individual genes involved in a specific biological process (development, stress response, etc.). RESULTS:We demonstrate that the ARTIVA approach generates detailed insights into the function and dynamics of complex biological systems and exploits efficiently time-course data in systems biology. In particular, two biological scenarios are analyzed: the developmental stages of Drosophila melanogaster and the response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to benomyl poisoning. CONCLUSIONS:ARTIVA does recover essential temporal dependencies in biological systems from transcriptional data, and provide a natural starting point to learn and investigate their dynamics in greater detail.},

Depletion of either gene product causes disruption of integrin-dependent cell adhesion, resulting in separation of the endoderm from the mesoderm; the endoderm then migrates farther anteriorly than it normally would, resulting in bilateral duplication of endodermal organs.

Intuitively, one might expect disease-causing variants to cluster into key pathways that drive disease etiology. But for complex traits, association signals tend to be spread across most of the genome-including near many genes without an obvious connection to disease. We propose that gene regulatory networks are sufficiently interconnected such that all genes expressed in disease-relevant cells are liable to affect the functions of core disease-related genes and that most heritability can be explained by effects on genes outside core pathways. We refer to this hypothesis as an "omnigenic" model.},

A typical tumor contains two to eight of these "driver gene" mutations; the remaining mutations are passengers that confer no selective growth advantage.

The transfer of HSCs was assayed by secondary marrow transplantation and was 1.0\% to 2.5\% after 3, 6, 8, and 12 weeks. Thus, HSC homeostasis is primarily maintained by the retention of stem cells derived from replication events within the marrow, not the homing and engraftment of HSCs from the circulation. Of interest, the phenotypes of marrow progenitors and granulocytes were similar to those for HSCs, implying that the marrow functions as an intact compartment where differentiating cells derive from endogenous HSC. In contrast, 50\% of splenic granulocytes and progenitor cells derived from the parabiotic partner, suggesting splenic progenitor cells were in constant equilibrium with progenitors in blood. In additional studies, animals were exposed to granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and stem cell factor at days 17 to 20 of parabiosis and were studied 3 weeks later; 10.1\% of marrow HSCs derived from the parabiotic partner. These data imply that HSCs, mobilized to the blood in response to cytokine exposure, are destined to later return to marrow, an observation that supports the concept that the mobilized peripheral blood stem cells used in clinical transplantation function physiologically.},

FAP is caused by germline mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. Somatic mutations in the APC gene are an early event in colorectal tumorigenesis, and can be detected in the majority of colorectal tumours. The APC gene encodes a large protein with multiple cellular functions and interactions, including roles in signal transduction in the wnt-signalling pathway, mediation of intercellular adhesion, stabilization of the cytoskeleton and possibly regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis. The fact that APC is an integral part of so many different pathways makes it an ideal target for mutation in carcinogenesis. This review deals with our understanding to date of how mutations in the APC gene translate into changes at the protein level, which in turn contribute to the role of APC in tumorigenesis.},

Recently, we proposed a novel theoretical concept and a corresponding quantitative model based on microenvironment-dependent stem cell plasticity. The objective of our present work is to subject this model to an experimental test for the situation of chimeric hematopoiesis. Investigating clonal competition processes in DBA/2-C57BL/6 mouse chimeras, we observed biphasic chimerism development with initially increasing but long-term declining DBA/2 contribution. These experimental results were used to select the parameters of the mathematical model. To validate the model beyond this specific situation, we fixed the obtained parameter configuration to simulate further experimental settings comprising variations of transplanted DBA/2-C57BL/6 proportions, secondary transplantations, and perturbation of stabilized chimeras by cytokine and cytotoxic treatment. We show that the proposed model is able to consistently describe the situation of chimeric hematopoiesis. Our results strongly support the view that the relative growth advantage of strain-specific stem cells is not a fixed cellular property but is sensitively dependent on the actual state of the entire system. We conclude that hematopoietic stem cell organization should be understood as a flexible, self-organized rather than a fixed, preprogrammed process.},

Characterizing cell growth, proliferation, intercalation and apoptosis in epithelia helps us to understand how morphogenetic processes such as tissue invagination and extension are locally regulated and controlled. Accurate cell tracking requires correctly resolving cells entering or leaving the field of view between frames, cell neighbour exchanges, cell removals and cell divisions. However, current tracking methods for epithelial sheets are not robust to large morphogenetic deformations and require significant manual interventions. Here, we present a novel algorithm for epithelial cell tracking, exploiting the graph-theoretic concept of a ‘maximum common subgraph’ to track cells between frames of a video. Our algorithm does not require the adjustment of tissue-specific parameters, and scales in sub-quadratic time with tissue size. It does not rely on precise positional information, permitting large cell movements between frames and enabling tracking in datasets acquired at low temporal resolution due to experimental constraints such as phototoxicity. To demonstrate the method, we perform tracking on the Drosophila embryonic epidermis and compare cell–cell rearrangements to previous studies in other tissues. Our implementation is open source and generally applicable to epithelial tissues.},

	abstract = {Tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) can be devastating because they often affect children, are difficult to treat, and frequently cause mental impairment or death. New insights into the causes and potential treatment of CNS tumors have come from discovering connections with genes that control cell growth, differentiation, and death during normal development. Links between tumorigenesis and normal development are illustrated by three common CNS tumors: retinoblastoma, glioblastoma, and medulloblastoma. For example, the retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor protein is crucial for control of normal neuronal differentiation and apoptosis. Excessive activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor and loss of the phosphatase PTEN are associated with glioblastoma, and both genes are required for normal growth and development. The membrane protein Patched1 (Ptc1), which controls cell fate in many tissues, regulates cell growth in the cerebellum, and reduced Ptc1 function contributes to medulloblastoma. Just as elucidating the mechanisms that control normal development can lead to the identification of new cancer-related genes and signaling pathways, studies of tumor biology can increase our understanding of normal development. Learning that Ptc1 is a medulloblastoma tumor suppressor led directly to the identification of the Ptc1 ligand, Sonic hedgehog, as a powerful mitogen for cerebellar granule cell precursors. Much remains to be learned about the genetic events that lead to brain tumors and how each event regulates cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and differentiation. The prospects for beneficial work at the boundary between oncology and developmental biology are great.},

On average in the UK, 23\% of travel time is lost in connections for trips with more than one mode, and the lack of synchronization decreases very slowly with population size. This lack of synchronization between modes induces differences between the theoretical quickest trip and the 'time-respecting' path, which takes into account waiting times at interconnection nodes. We analyse here the statistics of these paths on the multilayer, temporal network of the entire, multimodal british public transportation system. We propose a statistical decomposition - the 'anatomy' - of trips in urban areas, in terms of riding, waiting and walking times, and which shows how the temporal structure of trips varies with distance and allows us to compare different cities. Weaknesses in systems can be either insufficient transportation speed or service frequency, but the key parameter controlling their global efficiency is the total number of stop events per hour for all modes. This analysis suggests the need for better optimization strategies, adapted to short, long unimodal or multimodal trips.},

Through the use of genetically engineered mouse models, the manipulation of Xenopus and chick embryos, and the identification of human renal disease genes, the molecular bases for many of the early events in the developing kidney are becoming increasingly clear. Early patterning of the kidney region depends on interactions between Pax/Eya/Six genes, with essential roles for lim1 and Odd1. Ureteric bud outgrowth and branching morphogenesis are controlled by the Ret/Gdnf pathway, which is subject to positive and negative regulation by a variety of factors. A clear role for Wnt proteins in induction of the kidney mesenchyme is now well established and complements the classic literature nicely. Patterning along the proximal distal axis as the nephron develops is now being investigated and must involve aspects of Notch signaling. The development of a glomerulus requires interactions between epithelial cells and infiltrating endothelial cells to generate a unique basement membrane. The integrity of the glomerular filter depends in large part on the proteins of the nephrin complex, localized to the slit diaphragm. Despite the kidney's architectural complexity, with the advent of genomics and expression arrays, it is becoming one of the best-characterized organ systems in developmental biology.},

	abstract = {Ovol2 belongs to the Ovo family of evolutionarily conserved zinc finger transcription factors that act downstream of key developmental signaling pathways including Wg/Wnt and BMP/TGF-beta. We previously reported Ovol2 expression in the basal layer of epidermis, where epidermal stem/progenitor cells reside. In this work, we use HaCaT human keratinocytes to investigate the cellular and molecular functions of Ovol2. We show that depletion of Ovol2 leads to transient cell expansion but a loss of cells with long term proliferation potential. Mathematical modeling and experimental findings suggest that both faster cycling and precocious withdrawal from the cell cycle underlie this phenotype. Ovol2 depletion also accelerates extracellular signal-induced terminal differentiation in two- and three-dimensional culture models. By chromatin immunoprecipitation, luciferase reporter, and functional rescue assays, we demonstrate that Ovol2 directly represses two critical downstream targets, c-Myc and Notch1, thereby suppressing keratinocyte transient proliferation and terminal differentiation, respectively. These findings shed light on how an epidermal cell maintains a proliferation-competent and differentiation-resistant state.},

Yet, functional studies addressing the cellular origin of leukaemia are lacking. Here we show that the cells of origin of both, BCR/ABL-induced chronic myeloid (CML) and B-cell acute lymphoid leukaemia (B-ALL), resemble long-term haematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs). During disease-maintenance, CML LT-HSCs persist to function as cancer stem cells (CSCs) that maintain leukaemia and require signalling by the transcription factor STAT5. In contrast, B-ALL LT-HSCs differentiate into CSCs that correspond to pro-B cells. This transition step requires a transient IL-7 signal and is lost in IL-7Rα-deficient cells. Thus, in BCR/ABLp185$^{\textrm{+}}$ B-ALL and BCR/ABLp210$^{\textrm{+}}$ CML, the final phenotype of the tumour as well as the abundance of CSCs is dictated by diverging differentiation fates of their common cells of origin.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

At any one time, approximately 5\% of LT-HSC were in S/G2/M phases of the cell cycle and another 20\% were in G1 phase. BrdUrd incorporation was used to determine the rate at which different cohorts of HSC entered the cell cycle over time. About 50\% of LT-HSC incorporated BrdUrd by 6 days and {\textgreater}90\% incorporated BrdUrd by 30 days. By 6 months, 99\% of LT-HSC had incorporated BrdUrd. We calculated that approximately 8\% of LT-HSC asynchronously entered the cell cycle per day. Nested reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed cyclin D2 expression in a high proportion of LT-HSC. Although approximately 75\% of LT-HSC are quiescent in G0 at any one time, all HSC are recruited into cycle regularly such that 99\% of LT-HSC divide on average every 57 days.},

The branching of the ureteric bud is achieved by different cellular behaviors including cell proliferation and chemotaxis. In this paper, we examine how the branching morphology depends on different physical or chemical factors by constructing a cell-based model to describe the simple tube branching in the early kidney development. We conclude that a proper balance between growth speed of epithelial sheet due to cell proliferation and cell mobility due to chemotaxis is necessary to realize the development of normal Y-shaped pattern. When cell proliferation is fast compared to chemotaxis, kinked pattern is formed, and when cell proliferation is slow, bloated pattern is formed. These are consistent with experimental observations in different morphological anomalies of mutants. We show that the different branching patterns are accurately predicted by growth-chemotaxis ratio.},

	abstract = {The patterning of many developing tissues is organized by morphogens. Genetic and environmental perturbations of gene expression, protein synthesis and ligand binding are among the sources of unreliability that limit the accuracy and precision of morphogen-mediated patterning. While it has been found that the robustness of morphogen gradients to the perturbation of morphogen synthesis can be enhanced by particular mechanisms, how such mechanisms affect robustness to other perturbations, such as to receptor synthesis for the same morphogen, has been little explored. Here, we investigate the interplay between the robustness of patterning to the changes in receptor synthesis and morphogen synthesis and to the effects of cell-to-cell variability. Our analysis elucidates the trade-offs and constraints that arise as a result of achieving these three performance objectives simultaneously in the context of simple, steady-state morphogen gradients formed by diffusion and receptor-mediated uptake. Analysis of the interdependence between length scales of patterning and these performance objectives reveals several potential mechanisms for mitigating such trade-offs and constraints. One involves downregulation of receptor synthesis in the morphogen source, while another involves the presence of non-signalling cell-surface morphogen-binding molecules. Both of these mechanisms occur in Drosophila wing discs during their patterning. We computationally elucidate how these mechanisms improve the robustness and precision of morphogen-mediated patterning.},

	abstract = {Mathematical modelling of the movement of animals, micro-organisms and cells is of great relevance in the fields of biology, ecology and medicine. Movement models can take many different forms, but the most widely used are based on the extensions of simple random walk processes. In this review paper, our aim is twofold: to introduce the mathematics behind random walks in a straightforward manner and to explain how such models can be used to aid our understanding of biological processes. We introduce the mathematical theory behind the simple random walk and explain how this relates to Brownian motion and diffusive processes in general. We demonstrate how these simple models can be extended to include drift and waiting times or be used to calculate first passage times. We discuss biased random walks and show how hyperbolic models can be used to generate correlated random walks. We cover two main applications of the random walk model. Firstly, we review models and results relating to the movement, dispersal and population redistribution of animals and micro-organisms. This includes direct calculation of mean squared displacement, mean dispersal distance, tortuosity measures, as well as possible limitations of these model approaches. Secondly, oriented movement and chemotaxis models are reviewed. General hyperbolic models based on the linear transport equation are introduced and we show how a reinforced random walk can be used to model movement where the individual changes its environment. We discuss the applications of these models in the context of cell migration leading to blood vessel growth (angiogenesis). Finally, we discuss how the various random walk models and approaches are related and the connections that underpin many of the key processes involved.},

	abstract = {Wnt signalling is involved in a wide range of physiological and pathological processes. The presence of an extracellular Wnt stimulus induces cytoplasmic stabilisation and nuclear translocation of beta-catenin, a protein that also plays an essential role in cadherin-mediated adhesion. Two main hypotheses have been proposed concerning the balance between beta-catenin's adhesive and transcriptional functions: either beta-catenin's fate is determined by competition between its binding partners, or Wnt induces folding of beta-catenin into a conformation allocated preferentially to transcription. The experimental data supporting each hypotheses remain inconclusive. In this paper we present a new mathematical model of the Wnt pathway that incorporates beta-catenin's dual function. We use this model to carry out a series of in silico experiments and compare the behaviour of systems governed by each hypothesis. Our analytical results and model simulations provide further insight into the current understanding of Wnt signalling and, in particular, reveal differences in the response of the two modes of interaction between adhesion and signalling in certain in silico settings. We also exploit our model to investigate the impact of the mutations most commonly observed in human colorectal cancer. Simulations show that the amount of functional APC required to maintain a normal phenotype increases with increasing strength of the Wnt signal, a result which illustrates that the environment can substantially influence both tumour initiation and phenotype.},

However, due to the complex molecular compositions and spectral overlaps, the interpretation of cellular Raman spectra have remained unclear. In this report, we compared cellular Raman spectra to transcriptomes of Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Escherichia coli, and provide firm evidence that they can be computationally connected and interpreted. Specifically, we find that the dimensions of high-dimensional Raman spectra and transcriptomes measured by RNA-seq can be effectively reduced and connected linearly through a shared low-dimensional subspace. Accordingly, we were able to reconstruct global gene expression profiles by applying the calculated transformation matrix to Raman spectra, and vice versa. Strikingly, highly expressed ncRNAs contributed to the Raman-transcriptome linear correspondence more significantly than mRNAs in S. pombe, which implies their major role in coordinating molecular compositions. This compatibility between whole-cell Raman spectra and transcriptomes marks an important and promising step towards establishing spectroscopic live-cell omics studies.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In the model each cell is equipped with a micro-environment response network that determines the behaviour or phenotype of the cell based on the local environment. The response network is modelled using a feed-forward neural network, which is subject to mutations when the cells divide. This implies that cells might react differently to the environment and when space and nutrients are limited only the fittest cells will survive. With this model we have investigated the impact of the environment on the growth dynamics of the tumour. In particular, we have analysed the influence of the tissue oxygen concentration and extra-cellular matrix density on the dynamics of the model. We found that the environment influences both the growth and the evolutionary dynamics of the tumour. For low oxygen concentration we observe tumours with a fingered morphology, while increasing the matrix density gives rise to more compact tumours with wider fingers. The distribution of phenotypes in the tumour is also affected, and we observe that the glycolytic phenotype is most likely to emerge in a poorly oxygenated tissue with a high matrix density. Our results suggest that it is the combined effect of the oxygen concentration and matrix density that creates an environment where the glycolytic phenotype has a growth advantage and consequently is most likely to appear.},

	abstract = {Harnessing neural stem cells to repair neuronal damage is a promising potential treatment for neuronal diseases. To enable future therapeutic efficacy, the survival, proliferation, migration and differentiation of neural stem/progenitor cells (NPCs) should be accurately studied and optimized in in vitro platforms before transplanting these cells into the body for treatment purposes. Such studies can determine the appropriate quantities of the biochemical and biomechanical factors needed to control and optimize NPC behavior in vivo. In this study, NPCs were cultured within a microfluidic device while being encapsulated within the collagen matrix. The migration and differentiation of NPCs were studied in response to varying concentrations of nerve growth factor (NGF) and within varying densities of collagen matrices. It was shown that the migration and differentiation of NPCs can be significantly improved by providing the appropriate range of NGF concentrations while encapsulating the cells within the collagen matrix of optimal density. In particular, it was observed that within collagen matrices of intermediate density (0.9 mg ml{\textbackslash}textminus1), NPCs have a higher ability to migrate farther and in a collective manner while their differentiation into neurons is significantly higher and the cells can form protrusions and connections with their neighboring cells. Within collagen matrices with higher densities (1.8 mg ml{\textbackslash}textminus1), the cells did not migrate significantly as compared to the ones within lower matrix densities; within the matrices with lower collagen densities (0.45 mg ml{\textbackslash}textminus1) most of the cells migrated in an individual manner. However, no significant differentiation into neurons was observed for these two cases. It was also found that depending on the collagen matrix density, a minimum concentration of NGF caused a collective migration of NPCs, and a minimum concentration gradient of this factor stimulated the directional navigation of the cells. The results of this study can be implemented in designing platforms appropriate for regeneration of damaged neuronal systems.},

Several recent studies have measured variability in protein and messenger RNA levels, and they have discovered strong connections between noise and gene regulation mechanisms. When integrated with discrete stochastic models, measurements of cell-to-cell variability provide a sensitive "fingerprint" with which to explore fundamental questions of gene regulation. In this review, we highlight several studies that used gene expression variability to develop a quantitative understanding of the mechanisms and dynamics of gene regulation.},

	abstract = {Cancer progression is an example of a rapid adaptive process where evolving new traits is essential for survival and requires a high mutation rate. Precancerous cells acquire a few key mutations that drive rapid population growth and carcinogenesis. Cancer genomics demonstrates that these few driver mutations occur alongside thousands of random passenger mutations-a natural consequence of cancer's elevated mutation rate. Some passengers are deleterious to cancer cells, yet have been largely ignored in cancer research. In population genetics, however, the accumulation of mildly deleterious mutations has been shown to cause population meltdown. Here we develop a stochastic population model where beneficial drivers engage in a tug-of-war with frequent mildly deleterious passengers. These passengers present a barrier to cancer progression describable by a critical population size, below which most lesions fail to progress, and a critical mutation rate, above which cancers melt down. We find support for this model in cancer age-incidence and cancer genomics data that also allow us to estimate the fitness advantage of drivers and fitness costs of passengers. We identify two regimes of adaptive evolutionary dynamics and use these regimes to understand successes and failures of different treatment strategies. A tumor's load of deleterious passengers can explain previously paradoxical treatment outcomes and suggest that it could potentially serve as a biomarker of response to mutagenic therapies. The collective deleterious effect of passengers is currently an unexploited therapeutic target. We discuss how their effects might be exacerbated by current and future therapies.},

Here we describe MONSTER, Modeling Network State Transitions from Expression and Regulatory data, a regression-based method for inferring transcription factor drivers of cell state conditions at the gene regulatory network level. As a demonstration, we apply MONSTER to four different studies of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to identify transcription factors that alter the network structure as the cell state progresses toward the disease-state. Our results demonstrate that MONSTER can find strong regulatory signals that persist across studies and tissues of the same disease and that are not detectable using conventional analysis methods based on differential expression.

	abstract = {Tumor hypoxia is associated with low rates of cell proliferation and poor drug delivery, limiting the efficacy of many conventional therapies such as chemotherapy. Because many macrophages accumulate in hypoxic regions of tumors, one way to target tumor cells in these regions could be to use genetically engineered macrophages that express therapeutic genes when exposed to hypoxia. Systemic delivery of such therapeutic macrophages may also be enhanced by preloading them with nanomagnets and applying a magnetic field to the tumor site. Here, we use a new mathematical model to compare the effects of conventional cyclophosphamide therapy with those induced when macrophages are used to deliver hypoxia-inducible cytochrome P450 to locally activate cyclophosphamide. Our mathematical model describes the spatiotemporal dynamics of vascular tumor growth and treats cells as distinct entities. Model simulations predict that combining conventional and macrophage-based therapies would be synergistic, producing greater antitumor effects than the additive effects of each form of therapy. We find that timing is crucial in this combined approach with efficacy being greatest when the macrophage-based, hypoxia-targeted therapy is administered shortly before or concurrently with chemotherapy. Last, we show that therapy with genetically engineered macrophages is markedly enhanced by using the magnetic approach described above, and that this enhancement depends mainly on the strength of the applied field, rather than its direction. This insight may be important in the treatment of nonsuperficial tumors, where generating a specific orientation of a magnetic field may prove difficult. In conclusion, we demonstrate that mathematical modeling can be used to design and maximize the efficacy of combined therapeutic approaches in cancer.},

In addition to tissue engineering and transplantation studies, the need for functional CMs has also prompted researchers to explore molecular pathways and develop strategies to improve the quality, purity and quantity of hESC-derived and iPSC-derived CMs. In this review, we describe various approaches in directed CM differentiation and driven maturation, and discuss potential limitations associated with hESCs and iPSCs, with an emphasis on the role of epigenetic regulation and chromatin remodeling, in the context of the potential and challenges of using hESC-CMs and iPSC-CMs for drug discovery and toxicity screening, disease modeling, and clinical applications.},

	abstract = {Cancers are thought to arise in tissue stem cells, and similar to healthy tissue, are thought to be maintained by a small population of tumor stem or initiating cells, whereas the majority of tumor cells are more differentiated with limited replicative potential. Healthy tissue homeostasis is achieved by feedback loops, and particular importance has been attached to signals secreted from differentiated cells that inhibit stem-cell division and stem-cell self-renewal, as documented in the olfactory epithelium and other tissues. Therefore, a key event in carcinogenesis must be escape from these feedback loops, which is studied here using evolutionary computational models. We find that out of all potential evolutionary pathways, only one unique sequence of phenotypic transitions can lead to complete escape in stem-cell-driven tumors, even though the required mutations for these transitions are certainly tissue specific. This insight, supported by data, facilitates the search for driver mutations and for therapeutic targets. Different growth patterns can result from feedback escape, which we call "inhibited," "uninhibited," and "sigmoidal," and which are found in published data. The finding of inhibited growth patterns in data indicates that besides architecture, the regulatory mechanisms of healthy tissue continue to operate to a degree in tumors.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Since the first evidence for cancer stem cells in leukemia, experimentalists have sought to identify tumorigenic subpopulations in solid tumors. In parallel, scientists have argued over the implications of the existence of this subpopulation. On one side, the cancer stem cell hypothesis posits that a small subset of cells within a tumor are responsible for tumorigenesis and are capable of recapitulating the entire tumor on their own. Under this hypothesis, a tumor may be conceptualized as a series of coupled compartments, representing populations of progressively differentiated cell types, starting from stem cells. The allure of this model is that it elegantly explains our therapeutic failures: we have been targeting the wrong cells. Alternatively, the stochastic model states that all cells in a tumor can have stem-like properties, and have an equally small capability of forming a tumor. As tumors are, by nature, heterogeneous, there is ample evidence to support both hypotheses. We propose a mechanistic mathematical description that integrates these two theories, settling the dissonance between the schools of thought and providing a road map for integrating disparate experimental results into a single theoretical framework. We present experimental results from clonogenic assays that demonstrate the importance of defining this novel formulation, and the clarity that is provided when interpreting these results through the lens of this formulation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Furthermore, we show that those cells have an increased ability to form mammospheres, a property associated with mammary epithelial stem cells. Independent of this, stem cell-like cells isolated from HMLE cultures form mammospheres and express markers similar to those of HMLEs that have undergone an EMT. Moreover, stem-like cells isolated either from mouse or human mammary glands or mammary carcinomas express EMT markers. Finally, transformed human mammary epithelial cells that have undergone an EMT form mammospheres, soft agar colonies, and tumors more efficiently. These findings illustrate a direct link between the EMT and the gain of epithelial stem cell properties.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Essential biological functions of human cells, such as division, require the tight coordination of the activity of hundreds of proteins in space and time. While live cell imaging is a powerful tool to study the distribution and dynamics of individual proteins after fluorescence tagging, it has not yet been used to map protein networks due to the lack of systematic and quantitative experimental and computational approaches. Using the cell and nuclear boundaries as landmarks, we generated a 4D image data-driven, canonical, computational model for the morphological changes during mitotic progression of human cells. We show that this model can be used to integrate the dynamic distribution of 3D concentration data for many mitotic proteins imaged by absolutely calibrated fluorescence microscopy in a large number of dividing cells. Analysis of a pilot data set, containing 28 proteins of interest imaged in dividing cells, allowed us to automatically identify sub-cellular structures and quantify the timing and magnitude of protein fluxes between them, as well as predicting dynamic multi-molecular biological processes such as organelle dis/assembly. Our integrated experimental and computational method enables building a 4D protein atlas of the dividing human cell. As part of the MitoSys consortium, we provide here an approach that is generic and allows the systematic mapping and mining of dynamic protein localization networks that drive cellular functions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Interactions between the ureteric bud (UB) and metanephric mesenchyme are crucial for tubulogenesis during kidney development. Two immortalized cell lines derived from the day 11.5 embryonic kidney, UB cells, which appear to be epithelial (cytokeratin-positive, E-cadherin-positive, and ZO-1-positive by immunostaining) and BSN cells, which are largely mesenchymal (vimentin-positive, but negative for cytokeratin, cell surface E-cadherin, and cell surface ZO-1), were used to establish an in vitro tubulogenesis system. BSN cells expressed hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and transforming growth factor-beta1 mRNAs, and its conditioned medium (BSN-CM) contained factors capable of activating the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR). When UB cells were cultured in an extracellular matrix gel in the presence of the embryonic kidney or BSN-CM, the UB cells underwent morphogenetic changes characteristic of early in vitro branching tubulogenesis. These changes were largely inhibited by a combination of neutralizing anti-HGF antibodies and the EGFR inhibitor tyrphostin AG1478, suggesting that EGFR ligands, together with HGF, account for much of this early morphogenetic activity. Nevertheless, there was a significant fraction of tubulogenic activity that could not be inhibited, suggesting the existence of other soluble factors. Whereas HGF, EGF, transforming growth factor alpha, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), or a mixture of these growth factors, induced epithelial processes for up to 3 days, only IGF-1, possibly bFGF, and the mixture were able to sustain morphogenesis for longer periods, though not nearly to the same degree as BSN-CM. Moreover, only BSN-CM induced branching tubular structures with clear lumens, consistent with the existence of other soluble factors crucial for the formation and/or maintenance of branching tubular structures with lumens in vitro.},

We discuss a statistical approach–approximate Bayesian computation (ABC)–which allows us to approximate the posterior distribution over parameters and show how this can add insights into our understanding of the system dynamics. We illustrate the application of this approach and how the resulting posterior distribution can be analyzed in the context of the mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation cascade. Our analysis also highlights the added benefit of using the distribution of parameters rather than point estimates of parameter values when considering the notion of sloppy models in systems biology.},

In principle, synthetic niches can be engineered to give rise to patterned cell signaling, an advance that would transform the fields of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Biomaterials that display adhesive motifs are critical steps in this direction, but promoting localized signaling remains a major obstacle. We sought to exert precise spatial control over activation of TGF-$\beta$ signaling. TGF-$\beta$ signaling, which plays fundamental roles in development, tissue homeostasis, and cancer, is initiated by receptor oligomerization. We therefore hypothesized that preorganizing the transmembrane receptors would potentiate local TGF-$\beta$ signaling. To generate surfaces that would nucleate the signaling complex, we employed defined self-assembled monolayers that present peptide ligands to TGF-$\beta$ receptors. These displays of nondiffusible ligands do not compete with the growth factor but rather sensitize bound cells to subpicomolar concentrations of endogenous TGF-$\beta$. Cells adhering to the surfaces undergo TGF-$\beta$-mediated growth arrest and the epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Gene expression profiles reveal that the surfaces selectively regulate TGF-$\beta$ responsive genes. This strategy provides access to tailored surfaces that can deliver signals with spatial control.},

	abstract = {Oscillations play an important physiological role in a variety of biological systems. For example, respiration and carbohydrate synthesis are coupled to the circadian clock in cyanobacteria (Ishiura et al 1998 Science 281 1519) and ultradian oscillations with time periods of a few hours have been observed in immune response (NF-κB, Hoffmann et al 2002 Science 298 1241, Neson et al 2004 Science 306 704), apoptosis (p53, Lahav et al 2004 Nat. Genet. 36 53), development (Hes, Hirata et al 2002 Science 298 840) and growth hormone secretion (Plotsky and Vale 1985 Science 230 461, Zeitler et al 1991 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88 8920). Here we discuss how any bistable system can be 'frustrated' to produce oscillations of a desired nature—we use the term frustration, in analogy to frustrated spins in antiferromagnets, to refer to the addition of a negative feedback loop that destabilizes the bistable system. We show that the molecular implementation can use a wide variety of methods ranging from translation regulation, using small non-coding RNAs, to targeted protein modification to transcriptional regulation. We also introduce a simple graphical method for determining whether a particular implementation will produce oscillations. The shape of the resulting oscillations can be readily tuned to produce spiky and asymmetric oscillations—quite different from the shapes produced by synthetic oscillators (Elowitz and Leibler 2000 Nature 403 335, Fung et al 2005 Nature 435 118). The time period and amplitude can also be manipulated and these oscillators are easy to reset or switch on and off using a tunable external input. The mechanism of frustrated bistability could thus prove to be an easily implementable way to synthesize flexible, designable oscillators.},

	abstract = {Recent experimental work in lung morphogenesis has described an elegant pattern of branching phenomena. Two primary forms of branching have been identified: side branching and tip splitting. In our previous study of lung branching morphogenesis, we used a 4 variable partial differential equation (PDE), due to Meinhardt, as our mathematical model to describe the reaction and diffusion of morphogens creating those branched patterns. By altering key parameters in the model, we were able to reproduce all the branching styles and the switch between branching modes. Here, we attempt to explain the branching phenomena described above, as growing out of two fundamental instabilities, one in the longitudinal (growth) direction and the other in the transverse direction. We begin by decoupling the original branching process into two semi-independent sub-processes, 1) a classic activator/inhibitor system along the growing stalk, and 2) the spatial growth of the stalk. We then reduced the full branching model into an activator/inhibitor model that embeds growth of the stalk as a controllable parameter, to explore the mechanisms that determine different branching patterns. We found that, in this model, 1) side branching results from a pattern-formation instability of the activator/inhibitor subsystem in the longitudinal direction. This instability is far from equilibrium, requiring a large inhomogeneity in the initial conditions. It successively creates periodic activator peaks along the growing stalk, each of which later on migrates out and forms a side branch; 2) tip splitting is due to a Turing-style instability along the transversal direction, that creates the spatial splitting of the activator peak into 2 simultaneously-formed peaks at the growing tip, the occurrence of which requires the widening of the growing stalk. Tip splitting is abolished when transversal stalk widening is prevented; 3) when both instabilities are satisfied, tip bifurcation occurs together with side branching.},

	abstract = {Genetic switches exhibit multistability, form the basis of epigenetic memory, and are found in natural decision making systems, such as cell fate determination in developmental pathways. Synthetic genetic switches can be used for recording the presence of different environmental signals, for changing phenotype using synthetic inputs and as building blocks for higher-level sequential logic circuits. Understanding how multistable switches can be constructed and how they function within larger biological systems is therefore key to synthetic biology. Here we present a new computational tool, called StabilityFinder, that takes advantage of sequential Monte Carlo methods to identify regions of parameter space capable of producing multistable behaviour, while handling uncertainty in biochemical rate constants and initial conditions. The algorithm works by clustering trajectories in phase space, and iteratively minimizing a distance metric. Here we examine a collection of models of genetic switches, ranging from the deterministic Gardner toggle switch to stochastic models containing different positive feedback connections. We uncover the design principles behind making bistable, tristable and quadristable switches, and find that rate of gene expression is a key parameter. We demonstrate the ability of the framework to examine more complex systems and examine the design principles of a three gene switch. Our framework allows us to relax the assumptions that are often used in genetic switch models and we show that more complex abstractions are still capable of multistable behaviour. Our results suggest many ways in which genetic switches can be enhanced and offer designs for the construction of novel switches. Our analysis also highlights subtle changes in correlation of experimentally tunable parameters that can lead to bifurcations in deterministic and stochastic systems. Overall we demonstrate that StabilityFinder will be a valuable tool in the future design and construction of novel gene networks.},

	abstract = {The enzymatic control of the setting and maintenance of symmetric and non-symmetric DNA methylation patterns in a particular genome context is not well understood. Here, we describe a comprehensive analysis of DNA methylation patterns generated by high resolution sequencing of hairpin-bisulfite amplicons of selected single copy genes and repetitive elements (LINE1, B1, IAP-LTR-retrotransposons, and major satellites). The analysis unambiguously identifies a substantial amount of regional incomplete methylation maintenance, i.e. hemimethylated CpG positions, with variant degrees among cell types. Moreover, non-CpG cytosine methylation is confined to ESCs and exclusively catalysed by Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b. This sequence position-, cell type-, and region-dependent non-CpG methylation is strongly linked to neighboring CpG methylation and requires the presence of Dnmt3L. The generation of a comprehensive data set of 146,000 CpG dyads was used to apply and develop parameter estimated hidden Markov models (HMM) to calculate the relative contribution of DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts) for de novo and maintenance DNA methylation. The comparative modelling included wild-type ESCs and mutant ESCs deficient for Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b, or Dnmt3a/3b, respectively. The HMM analysis identifies a considerable de novo methylation activity for Dnmt1 at certain repetitive elements and single copy sequences. Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b contribute de novo function. However, both enzymes are also essential to maintain symmetrical CpG methylation at distinct repetitive and single copy sequences in ESCs.},

Such behaviors arise not through regulation of cell cycle speeds, but through the control of stem or progenitor self-renewal. Even though the spatial patterns that arise in this setting are the result of interactions between diffusible factors with antagonistic effects, morphogenesis is not the consequence of Turing-type instabilities.},

	abstract = {The skin surface – known as the epidermis – is made up of sheets of cells that are stacked up in layers. One of the roles of the skin is to provide a protective barrier that limits what leaks into or out of the body. A particular layer of the epidermis – referred to as the stratum granulosum – is primarily responsible for forming this barrier. The cells in this layer are sealed together in a zipper-like fashion by structures known as tight junctions. New skin cells are continuously produced in the lowest cell layers of the epidermis, and move upwards to integrate into the stratum granulosum layer to replace old cells (which also move upwards to leave the layer). How stratum granulosum cells are replaced without disrupting the tight junction barrier was not well understood. Yokouchi et al. used a technique called confocal microscopy to examine the stratum granulosum cells in the ears of mice, and found that the shape of these cells forms the basis of the barrier that they form. These cells resemble a flattened version of a shape called Kelvin’s tetrakaidecahedron: a 14-sided solid with six rectangular and eight hexagonal sides. This structure was proposed by Lord Kelvin in 1887 to be the best shape for filling space. Tight junctions are present on the edges of the flattened Kelvin’s tetrakaidecahedron. Further experiments revealed that the tight junctions move from cell to cell in a spatiotemporally-coordinated manner in order to maintain a continuous barrier throughout the stratum granulosum as cells are replaced. A newly formed stratum granulosum cell appears beneath the cell that it will replace. The shape of these cells enables a new barrier of three-way tight junction contacts to form between them and the neighboring cells in the stratum granulosum. After this barrier has formed, the upper cell leaves the stratum granulosum. Future research could address how cells adopt the flattened Kelvin’s tetrakaidecahedron shape, and discover why tight junctions only form in one layer of the epidermis.},

	abstract = {Genetic instability promotes cancer progression (by increasing the probability of cancerous mutations) as well as hinders it (by imposing a higher cell death rate for cells susceptible to cancerous mutation). With the loss of tumor suppressor gene function known to be responsible for a high percentage of breast and colorectal cancer (and a good fraction of lung cancer and other types as well), it is important to understand how genetic instability can be orchestrated toward carcinogenesis. In this context, this paper gives a complete characterization of the optimal (time-varying) cell mutation rate for the fastest time to a target cancerous cell population through the loss of both copies of a tumor suppressor gene. Similar to the (one-step) oncogene activation model previously analyzed, the optimal mutation rate of the present two-step model changes qualitatively with the convexity of the (mutation rate-dependent) cell death rate. However, the structure of the Hamiltonian for the new model differs significantly and intrinsically from that of the one-step model, and a completely new approach is needed for the solution of the present two-step problem. Considerable insight into the biology of optimal switching (between corner controls) is extracted from numerical results for cases with nonconvex death rates.},

	abstract = {Animal cells need to be able to communicate with each other so that they can work together in tissues and organs. To do so, cells release signaling molecules that can move around within a tissue and be detected by receptors on other cells. We tend to assume that the signaling molecules are evenly distributed across a tissue and affect all the receiving cells in the same way. However, random variations (noise) that affect how many of these molecules are produced, how they move through the space between cells and how they bind to receptors makes the reality much more complex. Cells responding to the signal somehow can ignore this noise and establish sharp boundaries between different cell types so that neighboring cells have distinct roles in the tissue. Few studies have attempted to measure such noise or address how cells manage to respond to noisy signals in a consistent manner. Retinoic acid is a signaling molecule that plays an important role in the development of the brain in animal embryos. It forms a gradient along the body of the embryo from the head end to the tail end, but it has proved difficult to measure this gradient directly. Sosnik et al. exploited the fact that this molecule is weakly fluorescent and used microscopy to directly detect it in zebrafish embryos. The experiments show that retinoic acid forms a gradient in the embryos, with high levels at the tail end and lower levels at the head end. Sosnik et al. also found that there is a large amount of noise in the retinoic acid gradient. Two cells in the same position can have very different retinoic acid levels, and the levels in a particular cell can vary from one minute to the next. The experiments also show that proteins that interact with retinoic acid help to reduce noise within a cell. This noise reduction is important for sharpening the boundaries between different brain regions in the embryo to allow the brain to develop normally. A future challenge will be to see if similar retinoic acid gradients and noise control occur in other tissues, and if the noise has any positive role to play in development.},

	abstract = {Growth of basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) requires high levels of hedgehog (HH) signalling through the transcription factor GLI. Although inhibitors of membrane protein smoothened (SMO) effectively suppress HH signalling, early tumour resistance illustrates the need for additional downstream targets for therapy. Here we identify atypical protein kinase C \$ıota\$/λ (aPKC-\$ıota\$/λ) as a novel GLI regulator in mammals. aPKC-\$ıota\$/λ and its polarity signalling partners co-localize at the centrosome and form a complex with missing-in-metastasis (MIM), a scaffolding protein that potentiates HH signalling. Genetic or pharmacological loss of aPKC-\$ıota\$/λ function blocks HH signalling and proliferation of BCC cells. Prkci is a HH target gene that forms a positive feedback loop with GLI and exists at increased levels in BCCs. Genome-wide transcriptional profiling shows that aPKC-\$ıota\$/λ and SMO control the expression of similar genes in tumour cells. aPKC-\$ıota\$/λ functions downstream of SMO to phosphorylate and activate GLI1, resulting in maximal DNA binding and transcriptional activation. Activated aPKC-\$ıota\$/λ is upregulated in SMO-inhibitor-resistant tumours and targeting aPKC-\$ıota\$/λ suppresses signalling and growth of resistant BCC cell lines. These results demonstrate that aPKC-\$ıota\$/λ is critical for HH-dependent processes and implicates aPKC-\$ıota\$/λ as a new, tumour-selective therapeutic target for the treatment of SMO-inhibitor-resistant cancers.},

Their focus is prevention of congenital disorders and genetic diseases at the population level, in addition to providing genetics services, including diagnosis and counseling. The proposed strategies include both newborn screening and population screening for carrier detection, in addition to lowering the incidence of congenital disorders and genetic diseases through the removal of environmental factors. In this article, we consider the potential impact of such testing on global health and highlight the near-term relevance of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and bioinformatic approaches to their implementation. Key attributes of NGS for community genetics programs are homogeneous approach, high multiplexing of diseases and samples, as well as rapidly falling costs of new technologies. In the near future, we estimate that appropriate use of population-specific test panels could cost as little as \$10 for 10 Mendelian disorders and could have a major impact on diseases that currently affect 2\% of children worldwide. However, the successful deployment of this technological innovation in LMICs will require high value for human life, thoughtful implementation, and autonomy of individual decisions, supported by appropriate genetic counseling and community education.},

At the core of an organs' ability to self-renew is the stem cell, which maintains homeostasis, and repopulates injured or aged tissue. Tissue damage can dramatically change the dimensions of an organ, and during regeneration, an organ must halt growth once the original tissue dimensions have been restored. Therefore, stem cells must give rise to the appropriate number of differentiated progeny to achieve homeostasis. How this tissue-size checkpoint is regulated and how tissue size information relayed to stem cell compartments is unclear, however, it is likely that these mechanisms are altered during the course of tumorigenesis. An emerging signaling cascade, the Hippo Signaling Pathway, is a broadly conserved potent organ size regulator [1]. However, this pathway does not act alone. A number of examples demonstrate crosstalk between Hippo and other signaling pathways including Wnt, Tgf$\beta$ and Notch, with implications for stem cell biology.

	abstract = {BackgroundGene regulation has, for the most part, been quantitatively analysed by assuming that regulatory mechanisms operate at thermodynamic equilibrium. This formalism was originally developed to analyse the binding and unbinding of transcription factors from naked DNA in eubacteria. Although widely used, it has made it difficult to understand the role of energy-dissipating, ¿epigenetic¿ mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, nucleosome remodelling and post-translational modification of histones and co-regulators, which act together with transcription factors to regulate gene expression in eukaryotes.ResultsHere, we introduce a graph-based framework which can accommodate non-equilibrium mechanisms. A gene-regulatory system is described as a graph, which specifies the DNA microstates (vertices), the transitions between microstates (edges) and the transition rates (edge labels). The graph yields a stochastic master equation for how microstate probabilities change over time. We show that this framework has broad scope by providing new insights into three very different ad hoc models, of steroid-hormone responsive genes, of inherently-bounded chromatin domains and of the yeast PHO5 gene. We find, moreover, surprising complexity in the regulation of PHO5, which has not yet been experimentally explored, and we show that this complexity is an inherent feature of being away from equilibrium. At equilibrium, microstate probabilities do not depend on how a microstate is reached but, away from equilibrium, each path to a microstate can contribute to its steady-state probability. Systems that are far from equilibrium thereby become history-dependent and the resulting complexity is a fundamental challenge. To begin addressing this, we introduce a graph-based concept of independence, which can be applied to sub-systems that are far from equilibrium, and prove that history-dependent complexity can be circumvented when sub-systems operate independently.ConclusionAs epigenomic data becomes increasingly available, we anticipate that gene function will come to be represented by graphs, as gene structure has been represented by sequences, and that the methods introduced here will provide a broader foundation for understanding how genes work.},

Although PYGO2 is highly overexpressed in a number of human cancers, the molecular mechanism underlying its deregulation is largely unknown. Here we report that Pygo2 protein is degraded through the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway and is posttranslationally stabilized through phosphorylation by activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling. Specifically, Pygo2 is stabilized upon inhibition of the proteasome, and its intracellular level is regulated by Cullin 4 (Cul4) and DNA damage-binding protein 1 (DDB1), components of the Cul4-DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Furthermore, Pygo2 is phosphorylated at multiple residues, and Akt-mediated phosphorylation at serine 48 leads to its decreased ubiquitylation and increased stability. Finally, we provide evidence that Akt and its upstream growth factors act in parallel with Wnt to stabilize Pygo2. Taken together, our findings highlight chromatin regulator Pygo2 as a common node downstream of oncogenic Wnt and Akt signaling pathways and underscore posttranslational modification, particularly phosphorylation and ubiquitylation, as a significant mode of regulation of Pygo2 protein expression.},

Non-oscillatory schemes of various orders of accu- racy are used to solve the equations, providing methods that accurately capture the formation of sharp gradients and cusps in the moving fronts. The algorithms handle topological merging and breaking naturally, work in any number of space dimensions, and do not require that the moving surface be written as a function. The methods can be also used for more general Hamilton-Jacobi- type problems. We demonstrate our algorithms by computing the solution to a variety of surface motion problems.},

Existing tools for quantitative analysis generally require expert knowledge. CellPD (cell phenotype digitizer) facilitates quantitative phenotype analysis, allowing users to fit mathematical models of cell population dynamics without specialized training. CellPD requires one input (a spreadsheet) and generates multiple outputs including parameter estimation reports, high-quality plots, and minable XML files. We validated CellPD’s estimates by comparing it with a previously published tool (cellGrowth) and with Microsoft Excel’s built-in functions. CellPD correctly estimates the net growth rate of cell cultures and is more robust to data sparsity than cellGrowth. When we tested CellPD’s usability, biologists (without training in computational modeling) ran CellPD correctly on sample data within 30 min. To demonstrate CellPD’s ability to aid in the analysis of high throughput data, we created a synthetic high content screening (HCS) data set, where a simulated cell line is exposed to two hypothetical drug compounds at several doses. CellPD correctly estimates the drug-dependent birth, death, and net growth rates. Furthermore, CellPD’s estimates quantify and distinguish between the cytostatic and cytotoxic effects of both drugs—analyses that cannot readily be performed with spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel or without specialized computational expertise and programming environments. CellPD is an open source tool that can be used by scientists (with or without a background in computational or mathematical modeling) to quantify key aspects of cell phenotypes (such as cell cycle and death parameters). Early applications of CellPD may include drug effect quantification, functional analysis of gene knockout experiments, data quality control, minable big data generation, and integration of biological data with computational models.},

	abstract = {As a nervous system develops, stem cells generate different types of nerve cells at different times. This series of events follows a fixed schedule in developing embryos, and even a single stem cell that is removed and then grown outside the body will follow the same schedule. This strongly suggests that stem cells have a built-in clock that controls their development. Studies of the developing nervous system of fruit flies reveal that this clock works by switching genes on in specific sequences, which defines which nerve cells are produced at different stages of development. However, a clock built from the genes that are currently known to be involved in the process is simply not fine-tuned enough to explain how so many different types of nerve cell develop at such precise times. This implies that scientists do not yet know all of the genes that are involved. Using genetic experiments in stem cells from fruit flies, Stratmann, Gabilondo et al. now identify additional clock genes that act to divide broad windows of time during development into smaller, more precise ones. Genes that define broad windows of time switch on the “small window” genes at specific times – a bit like large cogs turning small cogs in a clock. One small window gene, called Kruppel, works at different stages of development and it is possible that other small window genes multi-task in similar ways in other developmental clocks, such as those found in more complex organisms like humans. It is clear that many genes work in sequence in the developing nervous system to ensure that developmental stages happen at precise times. Stratmann, Gabilondo et al. will next investigate the molecular details of this timing, specifically how genes in sequential time windows connect together like cogs in the developmental clock.},

	abstract = {We established a theoretical framework for studying nonequilibrium networks with two distinct natures essential for characterizing the global probabilistic dynamics: the underlying potential landscape and the corresponding curl flux. We applied the idea to a biochemical oscillation network and found that the underlying potential landscape for the oscillation limit cycle has a distinct closed ring valley (Mexican hat-like) shape when the fluctuations are small. This global landscape structure leads to attractions of the system to the ring valley. On the ring, we found that the nonequilibrium flux is the driving force for oscillations. Therefore, both structured landscape and flux are needed to guarantee a robust oscillating network. The barrier height separating the oscillation ring and other areas derived from the landscape topography is shown to be correlated with the escaping time from the limit cycle attractor and provides a quantitative measure of the robustness for the network. The landscape becomes shallower and the closed ring valley shape structure becomes weaker (lower barrier height) with larger fluctuations. We observe that the period and the amplitude of the oscillations are more dispersed and oscillations become less coherent when the fluctuations increase. We also found that the entropy production of the whole network, characterizing the dissipation costs from the combined effects of both landscapes and fluxes, decreases when the fluctuations decrease. Therefore, less dissipation leads to more robust networks. Our approach is quite general and applicable to other networks, dynamical systems, and biological evolution. It can help in designing robust networks.},

	abstract = {Cells have to be able to reliably destroy or remove molecules from their interior that they no longer need. Structures called proteasomes play a central part in this complex process by cutting up and digesting proteins. Mammals have several different types of proteasomes, each made up of several protein ‘subunits’. For example, when a cell experiences inflammation some proteasomes change some of their subunits and form an immuno-proteasome. These immuno-proteasomes tend to break down proteins more quickly than ‘standard’ proteasomes, but it was not clear how they are able to do so. Liepe et al. have now combined experiments and mathematical modelling to construct a detailed model of proteasome activity. The model shows that protein transport into and out of the proteasome chamber are the steps that limit how quickly the proteasomes can break down proteins. Furthermore, these transport processes are also to a large extent responsible for the different rates at which standard and immuno-proteasomes process proteins. Liepe et al. were also able to confirm the existence of regulatory sites within the proteasome, and describe how these are arranged. Problems that alter the rate at which proteasomes break down proteins have been linked to tumors and neurological and autoimmune diseases. Liepe et al.'s model opens up the ability to study how the proteasome's activity is affected by drugs and therefore makes it easier to investigate ways of interfering with this activity for therapeutic purposes.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Absolute robustness allows biochemical networks to sustain a consistent steady-state output in the face of protein concentration variability from cell to cell. This property is structural and can be determined from the topology of the network alone regardless of rate parameters. An important question regarding these systems is the effect of discrete biochemical noise in the dynamical behaviour. In this paper, a variable freezing technique is developed to show that under mild hypotheses the corresponding stochastic system has a transiently robust behaviour. Specifically, after finite time the distribution of the output approximates a Poisson distribution, centred around the deterministic mean. The approximation becomes increasingly accurate, and it holds for increasingly long finite times, as the total protein concentrations grow to infinity. In particular, the stochastic system retains a transient, absolutely robust behaviour corresponding to the deterministic case. This result contrasts with the long-term dynamics of the stochastic system, which eventually must undergo an extinction event that eliminates robustness and is completely different from the deterministic dynamics. The transiently robust behaviour may be sufficient to carry out many forms of robust signal transduction and cellular decision-making in cellular organisms.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Using ribosome profiling and RNA-seq analysis, we found that Msi proteins regulate translation of genes implicated in epithelial cell biology and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and promote an epithelial splicing pattern. Overexpression of Msi proteins inhibited the translation of Jagged1, a factor required for EMT, and repressed EMT in cell culture and in mammary gland in vivo.

Second, multipotent neural crest cells generate multipotent progeny, indicating that they are capable of self-renewal and therefore are stem cells. Third, multipotent neural crest cells also generate some clonal progeny that form only neurons or glia, suggesting the production of committed neuroblasts and glioblasts.

The bronchial tree of most mammalian lungs is a good example of an efficient distribution system with an approximate fractal structure. Here we present a study of the compatibility between physical optimization and physiological robustness in the design of the human bronchial tree. We show that this physical optimization is critical in the sense that small variations in the geometry can induce very large variations in the net air flux. Maximum physical efficiency therefore cannot be a sufficient criterion for the physiological design of bronchial trees. Rather, the design of bronchial trees must be provided with a safety factor and the capacity for regulating airway calibre. Paradoxically, our results suggest that bronchial malfunction related to asthma is a necessary consequence of the optimized efficiency of the tree structure.},

	abstract = {Since we still know very little about stem cells in their natural environment, it is useful to explore their dynamics through modelling and simulation, as well as experimentally. Most models of stem cell systems are based on deterministic differential equations that ignore the natural heterogeneity of stem cell populations. This is not appropriate at the level of individual cells and niches, when randomness is more likely to affect dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a fast stochastic method for simulating a metapopulation of stem cell niche lineages, that is, many sub-populations that together form a heterogeneous metapopulation, over time. By selecting the common limiting timestep, our method ensures that the entire metapopulation is simulated synchronously. This is important, as it allows us to introduce interactions between separate niche lineages, which would otherwise be impossible. We expand our method to enable the coupling of many lineages into niche groups, where differentiated cells are pooled within each niche group. Using this method, we explore the dynamics of the haematopoietic system from a demand control system perspective. We find that coupling together niche lineages allows the organism to regulate blood cell numbers as closely as possible to the homeostatic optimum. Furthermore, coupled lineages respond better than uncoupled ones to random perturbations, here the loss of some myeloid cells. This could imply that it is advantageous for an organism to connect together its niche lineages into groups. Our results suggest that a potential fruitful empirical direction will be to understand how stem cell descendants communicate with the niche and how cancer may arise as a result of a failure of such communication.},

	abstract = {It is well known that current equilibrium-based models fall short as predictive descriptions of natural ecosystems, and particularly of fisheries systems that exhibit nonlinear dynamics. For example, model parameters assumed to be fixed constants may actually vary in time, models may fit well to existing data but lack out-of-sample predictive skill, and key driving variables may be misidentified due to transient (mirage) correlations that are common in nonlinear systems. With these frailties, it is somewhat surprising that static equilibrium models continue to be widely used. Here, we examine empirical dynamic modeling (EDM) as an alternative to imposed model equations and that accommodates both nonequilibrium dynamics and nonlinearity. Using time series from nine stocks of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) from the Fraser River system in British Columbia, Canada, we perform, for the the first time to our knowledge, real-data comparison of contemporary fisheries models with equivalent EDM formulations that explicitly use spawning stock and environmental variables to forecast recruitment. We find that EDM models produce more accurate and precise forecasts, and unlike extensions of the classic Ricker spawner-recruit equation, they show significant improvements when environmental factors are included. Our analysis demonstrates the strategic utility of EDM for incorporating environmental influences into fisheries forecasts and, more generally, for providing insight into how environmental factors can operate in forecast models, thus paving the way for equation-free mechanistic forecasting to be applied in management contexts.},

Here, a systems biology approach with the combination of computational analysis and animal experiment is used to investigate this complex issue, ZHENG, in the context of the neuro-endocrine-immune (NEI) system. By using the methods of literature mining, network analysis and topological comparison, it is found that hormones are predominant in the Cold ZHENG network, immune factors are predominant in the Hot ZHENG network, and these two networks are connected by neuro-transmitters. In addition, genes related to Hot ZHENG-related diseases are mainly present in the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway, whereas genes related to both the Cold-related and Hot-related diseases are linked to the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway. These computational findings were subsequently verified by experiments on a rat model of collagen-induced arthritis, which indicate that the Cold ZHENG-oriented herbs tend to affect the hub nodes in the Cold ZHENG network, and the Hot ZHENG-oriented herbs tend to affect the hub nodes in the Hot ZHENG network. These investigations demonstrate that the thousand-year-old concept of ZHENG may have a molecular basis with NEI as background.},

	abstract = {Author Summary A critical event in mammalian embryo development is construction of a mass of embryonic stem cells surrounded by a distinct shell that later forms the placenta along with other structures. Despite sustained investigation, multiple hypotheses for what is responsible for this organization persist and it remains unclear what is responsible for the robust organization (remarkable ability for embryos to pattern correctly) of these structures. Here, we utilize multi-scale, stochastic modeling along with fluorescence imaging to investigate the factors that contribute to the incredible robustness of this organizational process. Results point to two factors that contribute to this robustness: 1) the timing and pace of cell fate specification and 2) stochastic gene regulatory effects. The former creates a window of time during which each cell can continually read their environment and adjust their gene expressions (and consequently fate) in response to dynamic rearrangements of cells arising from cell divisions and motions. The latter improves cell plasticity, providing the capability for cells to adjust to changes in their local environment. Fluorescence imaging results demonstrate that the magnitude and structure of gene expression variations match those predicted to promote organizational robustness.},

I contend that it is time to move on and include much more richness in models. In particular, more thought needs to be given to the importance of (i) between-individual variation; (ii) the interaction between individuals, and hence the process by which decisions are reached; (iii) the ecological and life-history context of the situation; (iv) the traits that are under selection, and (v) the underlying psychological mechanisms that lead to behaviour. I give examples where including variation between individuals fundamentally changes predicted outcomes of a game. Variation also selects for real-time responses, again resulting in changed outcomes. Variation can select for other traits, such as choosiness and social sensitivity. More generally, many problems involve coevolution of more than one trait. I identify situations where a reductionist approach, in which a game is isolated from is ecological setting, can be misleading. I also highlight the need to consider flexibility of behaviour, mental states and other issues concerned with the evolution of mechanism.},

	doi = {10.1038/nature06457},
	abstract = {In the age of stem cell engineering it is critical to understand how stem cell activity is regulated during regeneration. Hairs are mini-organs that undergo cyclic regeneration throughout adult life, and are an important model for organ regeneration. Hair stem cells located in the follicle bulge are regulated by the surrounding microenvironment, or niche. The activation of such stem cells is cyclic, involving periodic beta-catenin activity. In the adult mouse, regeneration occurs in waves in a follicle population, implying coordination among adjacent follicles and the extrafollicular environment. Here we show that unexpected periodic expression of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (Bmp2) and Bmp4 in the dermis regulates this process. This BMP cycle is out of phase with the WNT/beta-catenin cycle, thus dividing the conventional telogen into new functional phases: one refractory and the other competent for hair regeneration, characterized by high and low BMP signalling, respectively. Overexpression of noggin, a BMP antagonist, in mouse skin resulted in a markedly shortened refractory phase and faster propagation of the regenerative wave. Transplantation of skin from this mutant onto a wild-type host showed that follicles in donor and host can affect their cycling behaviours mutually, with the outcome depending on the equilibrium of BMP activity in the dermis. Administration of BMP4 protein caused the competent region to become refractory. These results show that BMPs may be the long-sought 'chalone' inhibitors of hair growth postulated by classical experiments. Taken together, results presented in this study provide an example of hierarchical regulation of local organ stem cell homeostasis by the inter-organ macroenvironment. The expression of Bmp2 in subcutaneous adipocytes indicates physiological integration between these two thermo-regulatory organs. Our findings have practical importance for studies using mouse skin as a model for carcinogenesis, intra-cutaneous drug delivery and stem cell engineering studies, because they highlight the acute need to differentiate supportive versus inhibitory regions in the host skin.},

	abstract = {The chemotaxis network in Escherichia coli is remarkable for its sensitivity to small relative changes in the concentrations of multiple chemical signals over a broad range of ambient concentrations. Key to this sensitivity is an adaptation system that relies on methylation and demethylation (or deamidation) of specific modification sites of the chemoreceptors by the enzymes CheR and CheB, respectively. It was recently discovered that these enzymes can access five to seven receptors when tethered to a particular receptor. We show that these "assistance neighborhoods" are necessary for precise adaptation in a model for signaling by clusters of chemoreceptors. In agreement with experiment, model clusters composed of receptors of different types exhibit high sensitivity and precise adaptation over a wide range of chemical concentrations and the response of adapted clusters to addition/removal of attractant scales with free-energy change. We predict two limits of precise adaptation at large attractant concentrations: Either receptors reach full methylation and turn off, or receptors become saturated and cease to respond to attractant but retain their adapted activity.},

Axin is a negative regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway, and it is responsible for the formation of the beta-catenin degradation complex. Genetic studies with Drosophila suggest that Axin promotes cytoplasmic localization of beta-catenin independent of Axin's known role of enhancing degradation of beta-catenin. Here, we show that Axin is a nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling protein. Nuclear export of Axin depends on the chromosome maintenance region 1 nuclear receptor; treatment with the chromosome maintenance region 1 inhibitor leptomycin B induces nuclear accumulation of ectopically expressed or endogenous Axin. Functional nuclear localization and nuclear export signals have been mapped within Axin. Significantly, overexpression of an Axin fragment shifts coexpressed stabilized beta-catenin to the cytoplasm, and this effect requires shuttling of Axin between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Our results suggest that Axin functions as a molecular chaperone for beta-catenin and that nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of Axin regulates the nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of beta-catenin.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION:Large-scale gene expression profiling has been widely used to characterize cellular states in response to various disease conditions, genetic perturbations, etc. Although the cost of whole-genome expression profiles has been dropping steadily, generating a compendium of expression profiling over thousands of samples is still very expensive. Recognizing that gene expressions are often highly correlated, researchers from the NIH LINCS program have developed a cost-effective strategy of profiling only ∼1000 carefully selected landmark genes and relying on computational methods to infer the expression of remaining target genes. However, the computational approach adopted by the LINCS program is currently based on linear regression (LR), limiting its accuracy since it does not capture complex nonlinear relationship between expressions of genes. RESULTS:We present a deep learning method (abbreviated as D-GEX) to infer the expression of target genes from the expression of landmark genes. We used the microarray-based Gene Expression Omnibus dataset, consisting of 111K expression profiles, to train our model and compare its performance to those from other methods. In terms of mean absolute error averaged across all genes, deep learning significantly outperforms LR with 15.33\% relative improvement. A gene-wise comparative analysis shows that deep learning achieves lower error than LR in 99.97\% of the target genes. We also tested the performance of our learned model on an independent RNA-Seq-based GTEx dataset, which consists of 2921 expression profiles. Deep learning still outperforms LR with 6.57\% relative improvement, and achieves lower error in 81.31\% of the target genes.

Advances have been made in uncovering gene expression heterogeneity, discovering new cell types and novel identification of genes and transcription factors involved in cellular processes. One such approach to the analysis is to construct pseudotime orderings of cells as they progress through a particular biological process, such as cell-cycle or differentiation. These methods assign a score - known as the pseudotime - to each cell as a surrogate measure of progression. However, all published methods to date are purely algorithmic and lack any way to give uncertainty to the pseudotime assigned to a cell. Here we present a method that combines Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models (GP-LVM) with a recently published electroGP prior to perform Bayesian inference on the pseudotimes. We go on to show that the posterior variability in these pseudotimes leads to nontrivial uncertainty in the pseudo-temporal ordering of the cells and that pseudotimes should not be thought of as point estimates.},

	abstract = {Cyclin D1 is a well-characterised cell cycle regulator with established oncogenic capabilities. Despite these properties, studies report contrasting links to tumour aggressiveness. It has previously been shown that silencing cyclin D1 increases the migratory capacity of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with concomitant increase in 'inhibitor of differentiation 1' (ID1) gene expression. Id1 is known to be associated with more invasive features of cancer and with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Here, we sought to determine if the increase in cell motility following cyclin D1 silencing was mediated by Id1 and enhanced EMT-features. To further substantiate these findings we aimed to delineate the link between CCND1, ID1 and EMT, as well as clinical properties in primary breast cancer. Protein and gene expression of ID1, CCND1 and EMT markers were determined in MDA-MB-231 and ZR75 cells by western blot and qPCR. Cell migration and promoter occupancy were monitored by transwell and ChIP assays, respectively. Gene expression was analysed from publicly available datasets. The increase in cell migration following cyclin D1 silencing in MDA-MB-231 cells was abolished by Id1 siRNA treatment and we observed cyclin D1 occupancy of the Id1 promoter region. Moreover, ID1 and SNAI2 gene expression was increased following cyclin D1 knock-down, an effect reversed with Id1 siRNA treatment. Similar migratory and SNAI2 increases were noted for the ER-positive ZR75-1 cell line, but in an Id1-independent manner. In a meta-analysis of 1107 breast cancer samples, CCND1 low/ID1 high tumours displayed increased expression of EMT markers and were associated with reduced recurrence free survival. Finally, a greater percentage of CCND1 low/ID1 high tumours were found in the EMT-like 'claudin-low' subtype of breast cancer than in other subtypes. These results indicate that increased migration of MDA-MB-231 cells following cyclin D1 silencing can be mediated by Id1 and is linked to an increase in EMT markers. Moreover, we have confirmed a relationship between cyclin D1, Id1 and EMT in primary breast cancer, supporting our in vitro findings that low cyclin D1 expression can be linked to aggressive features in subgroups of breast cancer.},

We present a multiscale mathematical model of cancer invasion, which considers cellular and microenvironmental factors simultaneously and interactively. Unexpectedly, the model simulations predict that harsh tumor microenvironment conditions (e.g., hypoxia, heterogenous extracellular matrix) exert a dramatic selective force on the tumor, which grows as an invasive mass with fingering margins, dominated by a few clones with aggressive traits. In contrast, mild microenvironment conditions (e.g., normoxia, homogeneous matrix) allow clones with similar aggressive traits to coexist with less aggressive phenotypes in a heterogeneous tumor mass with smooth, noninvasive margins. Thus, the genetic make-up of a cancer cell may realize its invasive potential through a clonal evolution process driven by definable microenvironmental selective forces. Our mathematical model provides a theoretical/experimental framework to quantitatively characterize this selective pressure for invasion and test ways to eliminate it.},

The latter two phenomena are also observed in fast growing tumour cells and cell lines. These patterns suggest a fundamental principle of design. In biology such designs can often be understood as the result of the optimization of fitness. Here we show that in basic models of self-replicating systems these patterns are the consequence of maximizing the growth rate. Whereas most models of cellular growth consider a part of physiology, for instance only metabolism, the approach presented here integrates several subsystems to a complete self-replicating system. Such models can yield fundamentally different optimal strategies. In particular, it is shown how the shift in metabolic efficiency originates from a tradeoff between investments in enzyme synthesis and metabolic yields for alternative catabolic pathways. The models elucidate how the optimization of growth by natural selection shapes growth strategies.},

Our approach combines genetic information from infection samples with epidemiological information of patient exposure to infection. While epidemiological information has been traditionally used to understand who infected whom in an outbreak, detailed genetic information is increasingly becoming available with the steady progress of sequencing technologies. However, many complications, if unaccounted for, can affect the accuracy with which the transmission history is reconstructed. SCOTTI efficiently accounts for several complications, in particular within-patient genetic variation of the infectious organism, and non-sampled patients (such as asymptomatic patients). Thanks to these features, SCOTTI provides accurate reconstructions of transmission in complex scenarios, which will be important in finding and limiting the sources and routes of transmission, preventing the spread of infectious disease.},

We introduce scImpute, a statistical method to accurately and robustly impute the dropouts in scRNA-seq data. scImpute automatically identifies likely dropouts, and only perform imputation on these values without introducing new biases to the rest data. scImpute also detects outlier cells and excludes them from imputation. Evaluation based on both simulated and real human and mouse scRNA-seq data suggests that scImpute is an effective tool to recover transcriptome dynamics masked by dropouts. scImpute is shown to identify likely dropouts, enhance the clustering of cell subpopulations, improve the accuracy of differential expression analysis, and aid the study of gene expression dynamics.},

However, it is unclear if the calvarium is representative of all BM compartments. Using the combination of whole body optical imaging, intravital microscopy, and "in vivo fluorescence trapping," a thorough comparison of HSCs and putative HSC niches in the calvaria, epiphyses, and diaphyses, at steady state or after HSC transplantation, can be made. We report substantial heterogeneity between different BM compartments in terms of bone-remodeling activity (BRA), blood volume fraction (BVF), and hypoxia. Although BVF is high in all BM compartments, including areas adjacent to the endosteum, we found that compartments displaying the highest BVF and BRA were preferentially seeded and engrafted upon HSC transplantation. Unexpectedly, the macroanatomical distribution of HSCs at steady state is homogeneous across these 3 areas and independent of these 2 parameters and suggests the existence of "reconstituting niches," which are distinct from "homeostatic niches." Both types of niches were observed in the calvarium, indicating that endochondral ossification, the process needed for the formation of HSC niches during embryogenesis, is dispensable for the formation of HSC niches during adulthood.},

Mathematical modeling is expected to make an important contribution to this area, but the iterative development of increasingly accurate models will rely on repeated validation using experimental data of sufficient resolution to distinguish between alternative model scenarios. The multipotent hematopoietic progenitor FDCP-Mix cells maintain a hierarchy from self-renewal to post-mitotic differentiation in vitro and are accessible to detailed analysis. Here, we report the development of a combined mathematical modeling and experimental approach to study the principles underlying heterogeneity in FDCP-Mix cultures. We adapt a single-cell based model of hematopoiesis to the conditions of cell culture and describe an association between proliferative history and phenotype of FDCP-Mix cells. While data derived from population studies are incapable of distinguishing between three mechanistically different model scenarios, statistical analysis of single cell tracking data provides a resolution sufficient to select one of them. This scenario favors differences between granulocytic and monocytic lineage with respect to their proliferative behavior and death rates as a mechanistic explanation for the observed heterogeneity. Our results demonstrate the power of a combined experimental/modeling approach in which single cell fate analysis is the key to revealing regulatory principles at the cellular level.},

Although macro- phages of the reticuloendothelial system are positioned ideally to recognize and phagocytose apoptotic neutro- phils in the circulation, this review challenges the cur- rent dogma that neutrophils are cleared primarily in the liver and spleen, presenting the evidence that the bone marrow is also an important site of neutrophil clearance under homeostatic conditions. Furthermore, a role for the CXCL12/CXCR4 chemokine axis in the trafficking of senescent neutrophils back to the bone marrow for clearance is described.},

The first stem cell populations discovered were hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). In this paper, we present a deterministic model of bone marrow (that hosts HSCs) that is consistent with several of the qualitative biological observations. This model incorporates stem cell death (apoptosis) after a certain number of cell divisions and also demonstrates that a single HSC can potentially populate the entire bone marrow. It also demonstrates that there is a production of sufficient number of differentiated cells (RBCs, WBCs, etc.). We prove that our model of bone marrow is biologically consistent and it overcomes the biological feasibility limitations of previously reported models. The major contribution of our model is the flexibility it allows in choosing model parameters which permits several different simulations to be carried out in silico without affecting the homeostatic properties of the model. We have also performed agent-based simulation of the model of bone marrow system proposed in this paper. We have also included parameter details and the results obtained from the simulation. The program of the agent-based simulation of the proposed model is made available on a publicly accessible website.},

We may work within the Bayesian formalism, using Bayesian nonparametric approaches to model each dataset; or (for fast, approximate, and massive scale data fusion) can naturally switch to more heuristic modeling techniques. An advantage of the proposed approach is that each dataset can initially be modeled independently (in parallel), before applying a fast post-processing step to perform data integration. This allows us to incorporate new experimental data in an online fashion, without having to rerun all of the analysis. We first demonstrate the applicability of our tool on artificial data, and then on examples from the literature, which include yeast cell cycle, breast cancer and sporadic inclusion body myositis datasets.},

To test a theory on fundamental principles of cell fate dynamics (as opposed to the usually studied molecular mechanisms), we monitored such a fate decision in vitro using single-cell resolution gene expression analysis. We found that blood progenitor cells undergoing a fate decision to commit to either lineage after treatment with fate-determining cytokines, according to theory, first destabilized their original state. Cell states hereby diversified, manifesting the predicted flattening of an attractor’s potential well, which allows the increasingly vacillating progenitor cells to “spill” into adjacent potential wells corresponding to either lineage—myeloid or erythroid. This destabilization of an old stable state until suddenly opening access to new stable states is consistent with a critical transition (tipping point). We propose and demonstrate a new type of early warning signal that precedes critical transitions: an index IC based on a change in the high-dimensional cell population structure obtained from single-cell resolution measurements. This index may be used to predict imminent tipping point–like transitions in multicell systems, e.g., before pathological changes in tissues.},

	abstract = {The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) confers mesenchymal properties on epithelial cells and has been closely associated with the acquisition of aggressive traits by carcinoma cells. EMT programs are orchestrated by a set of pleiotropically acting transcription factors (TFs). The actions of these EMT-TFs enable the early steps of metastasis: local invasion and subsequent dissemination of carcinoma cells to distant sites. However, in most malignancies, the subsequent outgrowth of micrometastatic deposits into macroscopic metastases has the greatest impact on clinical progression. Such metastatic "colonization" reflects the ability of disseminated tumor cells to adapt to a foreign tissue microenvironment. The outgrowth of a metastasis is also thought to be associated with self-renewal, the defining cellular trait of cancer stem cells (CSCs), also termed tumor-initiating cells. Importantly, molecular links between EMT-TFs and self-renewal have emerged, suggesting that EMT programs play critical roles both early and late in the metastatic cascade. The genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that regulate the activation of EMT-TFs and the traits they induce are areas under intensive investigation. Such studies may provide new opportunities for therapeutic intervention and help to overcome tumor heterogeneity and therapeutic resistance.},

	abstract = {The existence of cancer stem cells has long been postulated, but was proven less than 20 years ago following the demonstration that only a small sub-fraction of leukemic cells from acute myeloid leukemia patients were able to propagate the disease in xenografts. These cells were termed leukemic stem cells since they exist at the apex of a loose hierarchy, possess extensive self-renewal and the ability to undergo limited differentiation into leukemic blasts. Acute myeloid leukemia is a heterogeneous condition at both the phenotypic and molecular level with a variety of distinct genetic alterations giving rise to the disease. Recent studies have highlighted that this heterogeneity extends to the leukemic stem cell, with this dynamic compartment evolving to overcome various selection pressures imposed upon it during disease progression. The result is a complex situation in which multiple pools of leukemic stem cells may exist within individual patients which differ both phenotypically and molecularly. Since leukemic stem cells are thought to be resistant to current chemotherapeutic regimens and mediate disease relapse, their study also has potentially profound clinical implications. Numerous studies have generated important recent advances in the field, including the identification of novel leukemic stem cell-specific cell surface antigens and gene expression signatures. These tools will no doubt prove invaluable for the rational design of targeted therapies in the future.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Cells physiology adapts globally to changes in growth conditions. This includes changes in cell division rate, cell size, and gene expression. These global physiological changes are expected to affect noise in gene expression in addition to average molecule concentrations. Gene expression is inherently stochastic, and the amount of noise in protein levels depends on both gene expression rates and the cell division cycle. Here, we model stochastic gene expression inside growing and dividing cells to study the effect of cell division rate on noise in gene expression. We use a modelling framework and parameters relevant to \textit{E. coli}, for which abundant quantitative data is available. We find that coupling of transcription rate (but not translation rate) with the division rate results in homeostasis of both protein concentration and noise across conditions. Interestingly, we find that the increased cell size at fast division rates, observed in \textit{E. coli} and other unicellular organisms, prevents noise increase even for proteins with decreased average expression at faster growth. We then investigate the functional importance of these regulations by considering gene regulatory networks that exhibit bistability and oscillations. We find that the topology of the gene regulatory network can affect its robustness with respect to changes in division rate in complex and unexpected ways. In particular, a simple model of persistence based on global physiological feedback predicts an increase in the persistence population at low division rates. Our study reveals a potential role for cell size regulation in the global control of gene expression noise. It also highlights that understanding of circuits9 robustness across growth conditions is key for the effective design of synthetic biological systems.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The stability of the Wnt pathway transcription factor b-catenin is tightly regulated by the multi-subunit destruction complex. Deregulated Wnt pathway activity has been implicated in many cancers, making this pathway an attractive target for anticancer therapies. However, the development of targeted Wnt pathway inhibitors has been hampered by the limited number of pathway components that are amenable to small molecule inhibition. Here, we used a chemical genetic screen to identify a small molecule, XAV939, which selectively inhibits b-catenin-mediated transcription. XAV939 stimulates b-catenin degradation by stabilizing axin, the concentration-limiting component of the destruction complex. Using a quantitative chemical proteomic approach, we discovered that XAV939 stabilizes axin by inhibiting the poly-ADP-ribosylating enzymes tankyrase 1 and tankyrase 2. Both tankyrase isoforms interact with a highly conserved domain of axin and stimulate its degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Thus, our study provides new mechanistic insights into the regulation of axin protein homeostasis and presents new avenues for targeted Wnt pathway therapies.},

Here, highly purified haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), progenitor and mature cell fractions from the blood of AML patients were found to contain recurrent DNMT3A mutations (DNMT3A(mut)) at high allele frequency, but without coincident NPM1 mutations (NPM1c) present in AML blasts. DNMT3A(mut)-bearing HSCs showed a multilineage repopulation advantage over non-mutated HSCs in xenografts, establishing their identity as pre-leukaemic HSCs. Pre-leukaemic HSCs were found in remission samples, indicating that they survive chemotherapy. Therefore DNMT3A(mut) arises early in AML evolution, probably in HSCs, leading to a clonally expanded pool of pre-leukaemic HSCs from which AML evolves. Our findings provide a paradigm for the detection and treatment of pre-leukaemic clones before the acquisition of additional genetic lesions engenders greater therapeutic resistance.},

RESULTS: We introduce Probabilistic Boolean Networks (PBN) that share the appealing rule-based properties of Boolean networks, but are robust in the face of uncertainty. We show how the dynamics of these networks can be studied in the probabilistic context of Markov chains, with standard Boolean networks being special cases. Then, we discuss the relationship between PBNs and Bayesian networks–a family of graphical models that explicitly represent probabilistic relationships between variables. We show how probabilistic dependencies between a gene and its parent genes, constituting the basic building blocks of Bayesian networks, can be obtained from PBNs. Finally, we present methods for quantifying the influence of genes on other genes, within the context of PBNs. Examples illustrating the above concepts are presented throughout the paper.},

Our experimental data uncovered clusters of small movement steps alternating with long moves independent of food encounter and landscape complexity. Moreover, size distributions of these clusters followed truncated power laws. These two findings are characteristic signatures of mechanisms underlying inherent Lévy-like movement. Thus, our study provides clear experimental evidence that such multi-scale movement is an inherent behaviour rather than resulting from the animal interacting with its environment.},

This affects how individual cells respond differentially to the same environmental stimulus. However, the origins of cell-to-cell variability in cellular signalling systems remain poorly understood. Here we measure the temporal evolution of phosphorylated MEK and ERK dynamics across populations of cells and quantify the levels of population heterogeneity over time using high-throughput image cytometry. We use a statistical modelling framework to show that upstream noise is the dominant factor causing cell-to-cell variability in ERK phosphorylation, rather than stochasticity in the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of ERK. In particular, the cell-to-cell variability during sustained phosphorylation stems from random fluctuations in the background upstream signalling processes, while during transient phosphorylation, the heterogeneity is primarily due to noise in the intensity of the upstream signal(s). We show that the core MEK/ERK system uses kinetic proof-reading to faithfully and robustly transmits these variable inputs. The MAPK cascade thus propagates cell-to-cell variability at the population level, rather than attenuating or increasing it.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Understanding under which conditions the increase of systems complexity is evolutionary advantageous, and how this trend is related to the modulation of the intrinsic noise, are fascinating issues of utmost importance for synthetic and systems biology. To get insights into these matters, we analyzed chemical reaction networks with different topologies and degrees of complexity, interacting or not with the environment. We showed that the global level of fluctuations at the steady state, as measured by the sum of the Fano factors of the number of molecules of all species, is directly related to the topology of the network. For systems with zero deficiency, this sum is constant and equal to the rank of the network. For higher deficiencies, we observed an increase or decrease of the fluctuation levels according to the values of the reaction fluxes that link internal species, multiplied by the associated stoichiometry. We showed that the noise is reduced when the fluxes all flow towards the species of higher complexity, whereas it is amplified when the fluxes are directed towards lower complexity species.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Poor wound healing after trauma, surgery, acute illness, or chronic disease conditions affects millions of people worldwide each year and is the consequence of poorly regulated elements of the healthy tissue repair response, including inflammation, angiogenesis, matrix deposition, and cell recruitment. Failure of one or several of these cellular processes is generally linked to an underlying clinical condition, such as vascular disease, diabetes, or aging, which are all frequently associated with healing pathologies. The search for clinical strategies that might improve the body's natural repair mechanisms will need to be based on a thorough understanding of the basic biology of repair and regeneration. In this review, we highlight emerging concepts in tissue regeneration and repair, and provide some perspectives on how to translate current knowledge into viable clinical approaches for treating patients with wound-healing pathologies.},

To perform this task effectively they must be able to integrate multiple stimuli and distinguish persistent signals from transient environmental fluctuations. However, the ways in which signaling networks process environmental noise are not well understood. Here we outline a mathematical framework that relates a network’s structure to its capacity to process noise, and use this framework to dissect the noise-processing ability of signaling networks. We find that complex networks that are dense in directed paths are poor noise processors, while those that are sparse and strongly directional process noise well. These results suggest that while cross-talk between signaling pathways may increase the ability of signaling networks to integrate multiple stimuli, too much cross-talk may compromise the ability of the network to distinguish signal from noise. To illustrate these general results we consider the structure of the signalling network that maintains pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells, and find an incoherent feedforward loop structure involving Stat3, Tfcp2l1, Esrrb, Klf2 and Klf4 is particularly important for noise-processing. Taken together these results suggest that noise-processing is an important function of signaling networks and they may be structured in part to optimize this task.},

An all-atom model of the I(Ks) alpha-subunit KCNQ1, based on the recent Kv1.2 structure, is used to calculate electrostatic energies during gating. Simulations are compared with experiments where varying degrees of positive charge-added via point mutation-progressively reduce current.

We find that breakdown of stem cell lineage confinement—granting privileges associated with both fates—is not only hallmark but also functional in cancer development. We show that lineage plasticity is critical in wound repair, where it operates transiently to redirect fates. Investigating mechanism, we discover that irrespective of cellular origin, lineage infidelity occurs in wounding when stress-responsive enhancers become activated and override homeostatic enhancers that govern lineage specificity. In cancer, stress-responsive transcription factor levels rise, causing lineage commanders to reach excess. When lineage and stress factors collaborate, they activate oncogenic enhancers that distinguish cancers from wounds.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Under the cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis, sustained metastatic growth requires the dissemination of a CSC from the primary tumour followed by its re-establishment in a secondary site. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a differentiation process crucial to normal development, has been implicated in conferring metastatic ability on carcinomas. Balancing these two concepts has led researchers to investigate a possible link between EMT and the CSC phenotype-indeed, recent evidence indicates that, following induction of EMT in human breast cancer and related cell lines, stem cell activity increased, as judged by the presence of cells displaying the CD44(high)/CD24(low) phenotype and an increase in the ability of cells to form mammospheres. We mathematically investigate the nature of this increase in stem cell activity. A stochastic model is used when small number of cells are under consideration, namely in simulating the mammosphere assay, while a related continuous model is used to probe the dynamics of larger cell populations. Two scenarios of EMT-mediated CSC enrichment are considered. In the first, differentiated cells re-acquire a CSC phenotype-this model implicates fully mature cells as key subjects of de-differentiation and entails a delay period of several days before de-differentiation occurs. In the second, pre-existing CSCs experience accelerated division and increased proportion of self-renewing divisions; a lack of perfect CSC biomarkers and cell sorting techniques requires that this model be considered, further emphasizing the need for better characterization of the mammary (cancer) stem cell hierarchy. Additionally, we suggest the utility of comparing mammosphere data to computational mammosphere simulations in elucidating the growth characteristics of mammary (cancer) stem cells.},

To define TAM, we prospectively analyzed clinical findings, blood counts and smears, and GATA1 mutation status in 200 DS neonates. All DS neonates had multiple blood count and smear abnormalities. Surprisingly, 195 of 200 (97.5\%) had circulating blasts. GATA1 mutations were detected by Sanger sequencing/denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (Ss/DHPLC) in 17 of 200 (8.5\%), all with blasts {\textgreater}10\%.

No clinical or hematologic features distinguished these 18 neonates. We suggest the term "silent TAM" for neonates with DS with GATA1 mutations detectable only by NGS. To identify all babies at risk of ML-DS, we suggest GATA1 mutation and blood count and smear analyses should be performed in DS neonates. Ss/DPHLC can be used for initial screening, but where GATA1 mutations are undetectable by Ss/DHPLC, NGS-based methods can identify neonates with small GATA1 mutant clones.},

	abstract = {To contribute to a deeper understanding of M-phase control in eukaryotic cells, we have constructed a model based on the biochemistry of M-phase promoting factor (MPF) in Xenopus oocyte extracts, where there is evidence for two positive feedback loops (MPF stimulates its own production by activating Cdc25 and inhibiting Wee1) and a negative feedback loop (MPF stimulates its own destruction by indirectly activating the ubiquitin pathway that degrades its cyclin subunit). To uncover the full dynamical possibilities of the control system, we translate the regulatory network into a set of differential equations and study these equations by graphical techniques and computer simulation. The positive feedback loops in the model account for thresholds and time lags in cyclin-induced and MPF-induced activation of MPF, and the model can be fitted quantitatively to these experimental observations. The negative feedback loop is consistent with observed time lags in MPF-induced cyclin degradation. Furthermore, our model indicates that there are two possible mechanisms for autonomous oscillations. One is driven by the positive feedback loops, resulting in phosphorylation and abrupt dephosphorylation of the Cdc2 subunit at an inhibitory tyrosine residue. These oscillations are typical of oocyte extracts. The other type is driven by the negative feedback loop, involving rapid cyclin turnover and negligible phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue of Cdc2. The early mitotic cycles of intact embryos exhibit such characteristics. In addition, by assuming that unreplicated DNA interferes with M-phase initiation by activating the phosphatases that oppose MPF in the positive feedback loops, we can simulate the effect of addition of sperm nuclei to oocyte extracts, and the lengthening of cycle times at the mid-blastula transition of intact embryos.},

	abstract = {Background: Tumours are diverse ecosystems with persistent heterogeneity in various cancer hallmarks like self-sufficiency of growth factor production for angiogenesis and reprogramming of energy-metabolism for aerobic glycolysis. This heterogeneity has consequences for diagnosis, treatment, and disease progression. Methods: We introduce the double goods game to study the dynamics of these traits using evolutionary game theory. We model glycolytic acid production as a public good for all tumour cells and oxygen from vascularization via VEGF production as a club good benefiting non-glycolytic tumour cells. This results in three viable phenotypic strategies: glycolytic, angiogenic, and aerobic non-angiogenic. Results: We classify the dynamics into three qualitatively distinct regimes: (1) fully glycolytic, (2) fully angiogenic, or (3) polyclonal in all three cell types. The third regime allows for dynamic heterogeneity even with linear goods, something that was not possible in prior public good models that considered glycolysis or growth-factor production in isolation. Conclusion: The cyclic dynamics of the polyclonal regime stress the importance of timing for anti-glycolysis treatments like lonidamine. The existence of qualitatively different dynamic regimes highlights the order effects of treatments. In particular, we consider the potential of vascular renormalization as a neoadjuvant therapy before follow up with interventions like buffer therapy.},

However, their developmental relationships remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that different MSC populations in the developing marrow of long bones have distinct functions. Proliferative mesoderm-derived nestin- MSCs participate in fetal skeletogenesis, and lose MSC activity soon after birth. In contrast, quiescent neural-crest-derived nestin+ cells preserve MSC activity, but do not generate fetal chondrocytes. Instead, they differentiate into HSC-niche-forming MSCs, helping to establish the HSC niche by secreting Cxcl12. Perineural migration of these cells to the bone marrow requires the ErbB3 receptor. The neonatal Nestin-GFP+ PDGFRα- cell population also contains Schwann-cell precursors, but does not comprise mature Schwann cells. Thus, in the developing bone marrow HSC-niche-forming MSCs share a common origin with sympathetic peripheral neurons and glial cells, and ontogenically distinct MSCs have non-overlapping functions in endochondrogenesis and HSC niche formation.},

	abstract = {The complexity of statistical methods for analysing clinical data can make interpreting clinical trial reports a daunting task for many readers. However, the key result of many trials could be presented and interpreted using quite basic statistical methods. The overall spirit of this article is to encourage all interested in understanding clinical trials to “feel the data” rather than get too absorbed in the technicalities (and occasional confusions) of advanced statistical techniques. For many trials the primary outcome is a disease event. This might be death or a composite outcome such as death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. The standard statistical methods—Cox proportional hazard models and log rank tests—take account of variation in patient follow-up times, but the consequent hazard ratios, confidence intervals, and P values seem a mysterious “black box” to some readers. Alternatively, if events relate to a fixed follow-up time then methods for comparing two proportions (for example, the χ2 test) may be used. This article describes a much easier method than these, which readers can use to assess quickly the strength of evidence for a treatment difference in an event outcome. It's surprising even how many statisticians don't know this simplest test: I first heard of it from a cardiologist. Consider a randomised clinical trial with two treatment groups of roughly equal size. Let the outcome of interest be a clinical event. The key data are the numbers of patients experiencing the event by treatment group. The figure shows how to perform a statistical test of significance based solely on these two numbers. Fig 1 How to perform the simplest statistical test of significance Calculate the difference in the two numbers of events and divide by the square root of their sum. Call the resulting number z.

We show that ZPO2 is recruited to GATA3 promoter in association with ZBTB32 (Repressor of GATA, ROG) and that ZBTB32 is essential for down-regulation of GATA3 via ZPO2. Through this modulation of GATA3 activity, ZPO2 promotes aggressive breast cancer development.

	abstract = {The experimental and clinical possibilities for studying cardiac arrhythmias in human ventricular myocardium are very limited. Therefore, the use of alternative methods such as computer simulations is of great importance. In this article we introduce a mathematical model of the action potential of human ventricular cells that, while including a high level of electrophysiological detail, is computationally cost-effective enough to be applied in large-scale spatial simulations for the study of reentrant arrhythmias. The model is based on recent experimental data on most of the major ionic currents: the fast sodium, L-type calcium, transient outward, rapid and slow delayed rectifier, and inward rectifier currents. The model includes a basic calcium dynamics, allowing for the realistic modeling of calcium transients, calcium current inactivation, and the contraction staircase. We are able to reproduce human epicardial, endocardial, and M cell action potentials and show that differences can be explained by differences in the transient outward and slow delayed rectifier currents. Our model reproduces the experimentally observed data on action potential duration restitution, which is an important characteristic for reentrant arrhythmias. The conduction velocity restitution of our model is broader than in other models and agrees better with available data. Finally, we model the dynamics of spiral wave rotation in a two-dimensional sheet of human ventricular tissue and show that the spiral wave follows a complex meandering pattern and has a period of 265 ms. We conclude that the proposed model reproduces a variety of electrophysiological behaviors and provides a basis for studies of reentrant arrhythmias in human ventricular tissue.},

So far however, there is no robust general molecular correlate of differentiation potential at the single cell level. Here we show that differentiation potency of a single cell can be approximated by computing the signaling promiscuity, or entropy, of a cells transcriptomic profile in the context of a cellular interaction network, without the need for model training or feature selection. We validate signaling entropy in over 7,000 single cell RNA-Seq profiles, representing all main differentiation stages, including time-course data. We develop a novel algorithm called Single Cell Entropy (SCENT), which correctly identifies known cell subpopulations of varying potency, enabling reconstruction of cell-lineage trajectories. By comparing bulk to single cell data, SCENT reveals that expression heterogeneity within single cell populations is regulated, pointing towards the importance of cell-cell interactions. In the context of cancer, SCENT can identify drug resistant cancer stem-cell phenotypes, including those obtained from circulating tumor cells. In summary, SCENT can directly estimate the differentiation potency and plasticity of single-cells, allowing unbiased quantification of intercellular heterogeneity, and providing a means to identify normal and cancer stem cell phenotypes.},

However, current cell models have limitations and are challenged to model detailed changes in cellular shapes and physical mechanics when thousands of migrating and interacting cells need to be modelled. Here we describe a novel dynamic cellular finite-element model (DyCelFEM), which accounts for changes in cellular shapes and mechanics. It also models the full range of cell motion, from movements of individual cells to collective cell migrations. The transmission of mechanical forces regulated by intercellular adhesions and their ruptures are also accounted for. Intra-cellular protein signalling networks controlling cell behaviours are embedded in individual cells. We employ DyCelFEM to examine specific effects of biochemical and mechanical cues in regulating cell migration and proliferation, and in controlling tissue patterning using a simplified re-epithelialization model of wound tissue. Our results suggest that biochemical cues are better at guiding cell migration with improved directionality and persistence, while mechanical cues are better at coordinating collective cell migration. Overall, DyCelFEM can be used to study developmental processes when a large population of migrating cells under mechanical and biochemical controls experience complex changes in cell shapes and mechanics.},

	abstract = {We develop a multispecies continuum model to simulate the spatiotemporal dynamics of cell lineages in solid tumors. The model accounts for protein signaling factors produced by cells in lineages, and nutrients supplied by the microenvironment. Together, these regulate the rates of proliferation, self-renewal and differentiation of cells within the lineages, and control cell population sizes and distributions. Terminally differentiated cells release proteins (e.g., from the TGF$\beta$ superfamily) that feedback upon less differentiated cells in the lineage both to promote differentiation and decrease rates of proliferation (and self-renewal). Stem cells release a short-range factor that promotes self-renewal (e.g., representative of Wnt signaling factors), as well as a long-range inhibitor of this factor (e.g., representative of Wnt inhibitors such as Dkk and SFRPs). We find that the progression of the tumors and their response to treatment is controlled by the spatiotemporal dynamics of the signaling processes. The model predicts the development of spatiotemporal heterogeneous distributions of the feedback factors (Wnt, Dkk and TGF$\beta$) and tumor cell populations with clusters of stem cells appearing at the tumor boundary, consistent with recent experiments. The nonlinear coupling between the heterogeneous expressions of growth factors and the heterogeneous distributions of cell populations at different lineage stages tends to create asymmetry in tumor shape that may sufficiently alter otherwise homeostatic feedback so as to favor escape from growth control. This occurs in a setting of invasive fingering, and enhanced aggressiveness after standard therapeutic interventions. We find, however, that combination therapy involving differentiation promoters and radiotherapy is very effective in eradicating such a tumor.},

Often one wants to compare such equations with observed time course data, and use this to estimate parameters. Surprisingly, practical algorithms for doing this are relatively poorly developed, particularly in comparison with the sophistication of numerical methods for solving both initial and boundary value problems for differential equations, and for locating and analysing bifurcations. A lack of good numerical fitting methods is particularly problematic in the context of systems biology where only a handful of time points may be available. In this paper, we present a survey of existing algorithms and describe the main approaches. We also introduce and evaluate a new efficient technique for estimating ODEs linear in parameters particularly suited to situations where noise levels are high and the number of data points is low. It employs a spline-based collocation scheme and alternates linear least squares minimization steps with repeated estimates of the noise-free values of the variables. This is reminiscent of expectation-maximization methods widely used for problems with nuisance parameters or missing data.},

	abstract = {Cells in animals use a process called differentiation to specialize into specific cell types such as skin cells and liver cells. Proteins called transcription factors drive particular steps in differentiation by controlling the activity of specific genes. Many transcription factors interact with each other to form complex networks that regulate gene activity to determine the fate of a cell and control the whole differentiation process. Some individual gene networks can program cells to become any one of several different cell fates, a feature known as multistability. In the 1950s, a scientist called Conrad Waddington proposed the concept of an “epigenetic landscape” to describe how the fate of a cell is decided as an animal develops. The cell, depicted as a ball, rolls down a rugged landscape and has the option of taking several different routes. Each route will eventually lead to a distinct cell fate. As the ball moves down the hill, the choice of routes and final destinations becomes more limited. Theoretical approaches have been used to understand how gene regulatory networks shape the epigenetic landscape of an animal. However, few studies have experimentally tested the findings of the theoretical approaches and it is not clear how environmental inputs help to determine which path a cell will take. Although bacteria cells do not generally specialize into particular cell types, bacteria cells can use multistability in transcription factor networks to switch between different behaviors or “states” in response to cues from the environment. Wu et al. used a bacterium called E. coli as a model to investigate how a gene network called MINPA from mammals, which is involved in differentiation and is believed to show multistability, can guide cells to adopt different states. The work combined experimental and mathematical approaches to design, construct and test an artificial version of the MINPA gene network in E. coli. The experiments showed that MINPA could direct the cells to adopt four different stable states in which the cells produced fluorescent proteins of different colors. With the help of mathematical modeling, Wu et al. charted how the landscape of cell states changed when external chemical cues were applied. Exposing the cells to several cues in particular orders guided the cells to different final states. The findings of Wu et al. shed new light on how the fate of a cell is determined and provide a theoretical framework for understanding the complex networks that control cell differentiation. This could help develop new ways of directing cell fate that could ultimately be used to generate cells to treat human diseases.},

	abstract = {A tumour is a heterogeneous population of cells that competes for limited resources. In the clinic, we typically probe the tumour by biopsy, and then characterize it by the dominant genetic clone. But genotypes are only the first link in the chain of hierarchical events that leads to a specific cell phenotype. The relationship between genotype and phenotype is not simple, and the so-called genotype to phenotype map is poorly understood. Many genotypes can produce the same phenotype, so genetic heterogeneity may not translate directly to phenotypic heterogeneity. We therefore choose to focus on the functional endpoint, the phenotype as defined by a collection of cellular traits (e.g. proliferative and migratory ability). Here, we will examine how phenotypic heterogeneity evolves in space and time and how the way in which phenotypes are inherited will drive this evolution. A tumour can be thought of as an ecosystem, which critically means that we cannot just consider it as a collection of mutated cells but more as a complex system of many interacting cellular and microenvironmental elements. At its simplest, a growing tumour with increased proliferation capacity must compete for space as a limited resource. Hypercellularity leads to a contact-inhibited core with a competitive proliferating rim. Evolution and selection occurs, and an individual cell's capacity to survive and propagate is determined by its combination of traits and interaction with the environment. With heterogeneity in phenotypes, the clone that will dominate is not always obvious as there are both local interactions and global pressures. Several combinations of phenotypes can coexist, changing the fitness of the whole. To understand some aspects of heterogeneity in a growing tumour, we build an off-lattice agent-based model consisting of individual cells with assigned trait values for proliferation and migration rates. We represent heterogeneity in these traits with frequency distributions and combinations of traits with density maps. How the distributions change over time is dependent on how traits are passed on to progeny cells, which is our main enquiry. We bypass the translation of genetics to behaviour by focusing on the functional end result of inheritance of the phenotype combined with the environmental influence of limited space.},

	abstract = {A fundamental question in cancer biology is whether cells with tumorigenic potential are common or rare within human cancers. Studies on diverse cancers, including melanoma, have indicated that only rare human cancer cells (0.1-0.0001\%) form tumours when transplanted into non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice. However, the extent to which NOD/SCID mice underestimate the frequency of tumorigenic human cancer cells has been uncertain. Here we show that modified xenotransplantation assay conditions, including the use of more highly immunocompromised NOD/SCID interleukin-2 receptor gamma chain null (Il2rg(-/-)) mice, can increase the detection of tumorigenic melanoma cells by several orders of magnitude. In limiting dilution assays, approximately 25\% of unselected melanoma cells from 12 different patients, including cells from primary and metastatic melanomas obtained directly from patients, formed tumours under these more permissive conditions. In single-cell transplants, an average of 27\% of unselected melanoma cells from four different patients formed tumours. Modifications to xenotransplantation assays can therefore dramatically increase the detectable frequency of tumorigenic cells, demonstrating that they are common in some human cancers.},

In order to make the most of such data we therefore require statistical tools that allow us to obtain reliable estimates for e.g. kinetic in vivo parameters. Here we show how we can use approximate Bayesian computation approaches in order to analyse leukocyte migration in zebrafish embryos in response to injuries. We track individual leukocytes using live imaging following surgical injury to the embryos' tail-fins. The signalling gradient that leukocytes follow towards the site of the injury cannot be directly measured but we can estimate its shape and how it changes with time from the directly observed patterns of leukocyte migration. By coupling simple models of immune signalling and leukocyte migration with the unknown gradient shape into a single statistical framework we can gain detailed insights into the tissue-wide processes that are involved in the innate immune response to wound injury. In particular we find conclusive evidence for a temporally and spatially changing signalling gradient that modulates the changing activity of the leukocyte population in the embryos. We conclude with a robustness analysis which highlights the most important factors determining the leukocyte dynamics. Our approach relies only on the ability to simulate numerically the process under investigation and is therefore also applicable in other in vivo contexts and studies.},

	abstract = {Fluorescent and luminescent proteins are often used as reporters of transcriptional activity. Given the prevalence of noise in biochemical systems, the time-series data arising from these is of significant interest in efforts to calibrate stochastic models of gene expression and obtain information about sources of nongenetic variability. We present a statistical inference framework that can be used to estimate kinetic parameters of gene expression, as well as the strength and half-life of extrinsic noise from single fluorescent-reporter-gene time-series data. The method takes into account stochastic variability in a fluorescent signal resulting from intrinsic noise of gene expression, kinetics of fluorescent protein maturation, and extrinsic noise, which is assumed to arise at transcriptional level. We use the linear noise approximation and derive an explicit formula for the likelihood of observed fluorescent data. The method is embedded in a Bayesian paradigm, so that certain parameters can be informed from other experiments allowing portability of results across different studies. Inference is performed using Markov chain Monte Carlo. Fluorescent reporters are primary tools to observe dynamics of gene expression and the correct interpretation of fluorescent data is crucial to investigating these fundamental processes of cellular life. As both magnitude and frequency of the noise may have a dramatic effect on the cell fitness, the quantification of stochastic fluctuation is essential to the understanding of how genes are regulated. Our method provides a framework that addresses this important question.},

	abstract = {Cell proliferation and differentiation is described by a multi-type branching process, a probability model that defines the inheritance of cell type. Cell type is defined by (i) a repression index related to the time required for S-phase entry and (ii) phenotype as determined by cell markers and division history. The inheritance of cell type is expressed as the expected number and type of progeny cells produced by a mother cell given her type. Expressions for the expected number and type of cells produced by a multi-cellular (bulk culture) system are derived from the general model by making the simplifying assumption that cell generation times are independent. The multi-type Smith-Martin model (MSM) makes the further assumption that cell generation times are lag-exponentially distributed with phenotype transitions occurring just before entry into S-phase. The inheritance-modified MSM (IMSM) model includes the influence of generation time memory so that mother and daughter generation times are correlated. The expansion of human cord blood CD34(+) cells by haematopoietic growth factors was division tracked in bulk culture using carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester (CFDA-SE). The MSM model was fitted to division tracking data to identify cell cycle length, and the rates of CD34 antigen down-regulation and apoptosis. The IMSM model was estimated for mouse granulocyte-macrophage progenitors using live cell imaging data. Multi-type branching models describe cell differentiation dynamics at both single- and multi-cell scales, providing a new paradigm for systematic analysis of stem and progenitor cell development.},

We reveal pervasive discordance, which can be largely understood as a dynamic imbalance due to delayed protein synthesis and degradation. Through a combination of systematic classification and kinetic modeling, we connect modes of regulation at the protein level to the function of specific gene sets in differentiation. We further show that our kinetic model can be applied to single-cell transcriptomics data to predict protein levels in differentiated cell types.

We thoroughly evaluate the performance of our algorithm and demonstrate that the higher-order information captured by PIDC allows it to outperform pairwise mutual information-based algorithms when recovering true relationships present in simulated data. We also infer gene regulatory networks from three experimental single-cell datasets and illustrate how network context, choices made during analysis, and sources of variability affect network inference.

The evolution is controlled by the initial density of centrists (o). For any spatial dimension the system reaches a centrist consensus with probability rho(o), while with probability 1 - rho(o) the final state is either an extremist consensus, or a frozen population of leftists and rightists. In one dimension, we determine the opinion evolution by mapping the system onto a spin-1 Ising model with zero- temperature Glauber kinetics.

	abstract = {Author Summary Variability among members of a clonal cell population is increasingly recognized as a near-universal characteristic of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Variability can arise from random fluctuations in the biochemical reactions that control gene transcription, protein synthesis or signal transduction networks. For variability in receptor-mediated signaling responses (in the current work, those activated by the death-inducing ligand TRAIL), we can often distinguish between the influence of stochastic processes that occur prior to ligand exposure and those that occur subsequently. One manifestation of prior variability is cell-to-cell differences in protein concentrations, and this paper uses a combination of modeling and experimentation to ask how these differences impact variability in phenotype, specifically with respect to the timing and probability of cell death. We find that fluctuations in multiple proteins contribute jointly to phenotypic variability, that the contributions of specific proteins to phenotypic variability are highly sensitive to the concentrations of other proteins, and that correlations in protein levels (detectable experimentally) also have a measurable impact on phenotype. Our work provides insight into the regulation of apoptosis and also represents a general approach for understanding cell-to-cell variability in signal transduction pathways.},

	abstract = {During gastrulation, epiblast cells are pluripotent and their fate is thought to be constrained principally by their position. Cell fate is progressively restricted by localised signalling cues from areas including the primitive streak. However, it is unknown whether this restriction accompanies, at the individual cell level, a reduction in potency. Investigation of these early transition events in vitro is possible via the use of epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs), self-renewing pluripotent cell lines equivalent to the postimplantation epiblast. Strikingly, mouse EpiSCs express gastrulation stage regional markers in self-renewing conditions. Here, we examined the differentiation potential of cells expressing such lineage markers. We show that undifferentiated EpiSC cultures contain a major subfraction of cells with reversible early primitive streak characteristics, which is mutually exclusive to a neural-like fraction. Using in vitro differentiation assays and embryo grafting we demonstrate that primitive streak-like EpiSCs are biased towards mesoderm and endoderm fates while retaining pluripotency. The acquisition of primitive streak characteristics by self-renewing EpiSCs is mediated by endogenous Wnt signalling. Elevation of Wnt activity promotes restriction towards primitive streak-associated lineages with mesendodermal and neuromesodermal characteristics. Collectively, our data suggest that EpiSC pluripotency encompasses a range of reversible lineage-biased states reflecting the birth of pioneer lineage precursors from a pool of uncommitted EpiSCs similar to the earliest cell fate restriction events taking place in the gastrula stage epiblast.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Recent advances in single-cell transcriptional profiling technologies provide a means to shed new light on the dynamic regulation of physiological processes at the single-cell level. Single-cell gene expression data taken during cell differentiation have led to novel insights on the functional role of cell-to-cell variability. Here, the clustering of cells, the reconstruction of cell lineage progression and developmental trajectory, and the identification of key genes involved in the cell fate decision making, are among the most common-yet-challenging data analytical tasks. In this work, we developed CALISTA (Clustering And Lineage Inference in Single-Cell Transcriptional Analysis) for clustering and lineage inference analysis using single-cell transcriptional profiles. CALISTA adopts a likelihood-based approach using the two-state model of stochastic gene transcriptional bursts to capture the heterogeneity of single-cell gene expression. We demonstrated the efficacy of CALISTA by applying the method to single-cell gene expression datasets (RT-qPCR and RNA-sequencing) from four cell differentiation systems without any lineage bifurcation and with one or multiple lineage bifurcations.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Cytokine flow cytometry (CFC) or intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) can quantitate antigen-specific T cell responses in settings such as experimental vaccination. Standardization of ICS among laboratories performing vaccine studies would provide a common platform by which to compare the immunogenicity of different vaccine candidates across multiple international organizations conducting clinical trials. As such, a study was carried out among several laboratories involved in HIV clinical trials, to define the inter-lab precision of ICS using various sample types, and using a common protocol for each experiment (see additional files online). RESULTS:Three sample types (activated, fixed, and frozen whole blood; fresh whole blood; and cryopreserved PBMC) were shipped to various sites, where ICS assays using cytomegalovirus (CMV) pp65 peptide mix or control antigens were performed in parallel in 96-well plates. For one experiment, antigens and antibody cocktails were lyophilised into 96-well plates to simplify and standardize the assay setup. Results ((CD4+)cytokine+ cells and (CD8+)cytokine+ cells) were determined by each site. Raw data were also sent to a central site for batch analysis with a dynamic gating template. Mean inter-laboratory coefficient of variation (C.V.) ranged from 17-44\% depending upon the sample type and analysis method. Cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) yielded lower inter-lab C.V.'s than whole blood. Centralized analysis (using a dynamic gating template) reduced the inter-lab C.V. by 5-20\%, depending upon the experiment. The inter-lab C.V. was lowest (18-24\%) for samples with a mean of {\textgreater} 0.5\% IFNgamma + T cells, and highest (57-82\%) for samples with a mean of {\textless} 0.1\% IFNgamma + cells. CONCLUSION:ICS assays can be performed by multiple laboratories using a common protocol with good inter-laboratory precision, which improves as the frequency of responding cells increases. Cryopreserved PBMC may yield slightly more consistent results than shipped whole blood. Analysis, particularly gating, is a significant source of variability, and can be reduced by centralized analysis and/or use of a standardized dynamic gating template. Use of pre-aliquoted lyophilized reagents for stimulation and staining can provide further standardization to these assays.},

By contrast, epiblast stem cells, a developmentally advanced state, only specified anterior identities, but without patterning.

Whether such gene pairs share a local chemical or regulatory relationship or interact via a non-local mechanism has implications for the co-evolution of genetic changes, development of alternatives to gene therapy, and the design of combination antimicrobial therapies that select against resistance. Yet, we lack a comprehensive knowledge of adaptive responses to metabolic mutations, and our understanding of the mechanisms underlying genetic rescue remains limited. We present results of a laboratory evolution approach that has the potential to address both challenges, showing that mutations in specific regions of RNA polymerase enhance growth rates of distinct mutant strains of Escherichia coli with a spectrum of growth defects. Several of these adaptive mutations are deleterious when engineered directly into the original wild-type strain under alternative cultivation conditions, and thus have epistatic rescue properties when paired with the corresponding primary metabolic gene deletions. Our combination of adaptive evolution, directed genetic engineering, and mathematical analysis of transcription and growth rate distinguishes between rescue interactions that are specific or non-specific to a particular deletion. Our study further supports a model for RNA polymerase as a locus of convergent adaptive evolution from different sub-optimal metabolic starting points.},

Analyzing expression data from 56 published reports, we found that cells derived via directed differentiation more closely resemble their in vivo counterparts than products of direct conversion, as reflected by the establishment of target cell-type gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Furthermore, we discovered that directly converted cells fail to adequately silence expression programs of the starting population and that the establishment of unintended GRNs is common to virtually every cellular engineering paradigm.

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: The integration of multiple datasets remains a key challenge in systems biology and genomic medicine. Modern high-throughput technologies generate a broad array of different data types, providing distinct - but often complementary - information. We present a Bayesian method for the unsupervised integrative modelling of multiple datasets, which we refer to as MDI (Multiple Dataset Integration). MDI can integrate information from a wide range of different datasets and data types simultaneously (including the ability to model time series data explicitly using Gaussian processes). Each dataset is modelled using a Dirichlet-multinomial allocation (DMA) mixture model, with dependencies between these models captured via parameters that describe the agreement among the datasets. RESULTS: Using a set of 6 artificially constructed time series datasets, we show that MDI is able to integrate a significant number of datasets simultaneously, and that it successfully captures the underlying structural similarity between the datasets. We also analyse a variety of real S. cerevisiae datasets. In the 2-dataset case, we show that MDI's performance is comparable to the present state of the art. We then move beyond the capabilities of current approaches and integrate gene expression, ChIP-chip and protein-protein interaction data, to identify a set of protein complexes for which genes are co-regulated during the cell cycle. Comparisons to other unsupervised data integration techniques - as well as to non-integrative approaches - demonstrate that MDI is very competitive, while also providing information that would be difficult or impossible to extract using other methods.

Bistability may be of particular relevance to biological systems that switch between discrete states, generate oscillatory responses, or "remember" transitory stimuli. Standard mathematical methods allow the detection of bistability in some very simple feedback systems (systems with one or two proteins or genes that either activate each other or inhibit each other), but realistic depictions of signal transduction networks are invariably much more complex. Here, we show that for a class of feedback systems of arbitrary order the stability properties of the system can be deduced mathematically from how the system behaves when feedback is blocked. Provided that this open-loop, feedback-blocked system is monotone and possesses a sigmoidal characteristic, the system is guaranteed to be bistable for some range of feedback strengths. We present a simple graphical method for deducing the stability behavior and bifurcation diagrams for such systems and illustrate the method with two examples taken from recent experimental studies of bistable systems: a two-variable Cdc2/Wee1 system and a more complicated five-variable mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Multilevelness is a defining characteristic of complex systems. For example, in the intestinal tissue the epithelial lining is organized into crypts that are maintained by a niche of stem cells. The behavior of the system 'as a whole' is considered to emerge from the functioning and interactions of its parts. What we are seeking here is a conceptual framework to demonstrate how the "fate" of intestinal crypts is an emergent property that inherently arises from the complex yet robust underlying biology of stem cells. RESULTS:We establish a conceptual framework in which to formalize cross-level principles in the context of tissue organization. To this end we provide a definition for stemness, which is the propensity of a cell lineage to contribute to a tissue fate. We do not consider stemness a property of a cell but link it to the process in which a cell lineage contributes towards tissue (mal)function. We furthermore show that the only logically feasible relationship between the stemness of cell lineages and the emergent fate of their tissue, which satisfies the given criteria, is one of dominance from a particular lineage. CONCLUSIONS:The dominance theorem, conceived and proven in this paper, provides support for the concepts of niche succession and monoclonal conversion in intestinal crypts as bottom-up relations, while crypt fission is postulated to be a top-down principle.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The availability of high-resolution single-cell data makes data analysis and interpretation an important open problem, for example, to disentangle sources of cell-to-cell and intra-cellular variability. Nonlinear mixed effects models (NLMEs), well established in pharmacometrics, account for such multiple sources of variations, but their estimation is often difficult. Single cell analysis is an even more challenging application with larger data sets and models that are more complicated. Here, we show how to leverage the quality of time-lapse microscopy data with a simple two-stage method to estimate realistic dynamic NLMEs accurately. We demonstrate accuracy by benchmarking with a published model and dataset, and scalability with a new mechanistic model and corresponding dataset for amino acid transporter endocytosis in budding yeast. We also propose variation-based sensitivity analysis to identify time-dependent causes of cell-to-cell variability, highlighting important sub-processes in endocytosis. Generality and simplicity of the approach will facilitate customized extensions for analyzing single-cell dynamics.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

However, a number of observations remain poorly understood from the standpoint of this paradigm in its contemporary state. These observations include the similar age-dependent exponential rise in incidence of cancers originating from stem/progenitor pools differing drastically in size, age-dependent cell division profiles, and compartmentalization. This common incidence pattern is characteristic of cancers requiring different numbers of oncogenic mutations, and it scales to very divergent life spans of mammalian species. Also, bigger mammals with larger underlying stem cell pools are not proportionally more prone to cancer, an observation known as Peto's paradox. Here, we present a number of factors beyond the occurrence of oncogenic mutations that are unaccounted for in the current model of cancer development but should have significant impacts on cancer incidence. Furthermore, we propose a revision of the current understanding for how oncogenic and other functional somatic mutations affect cellular fitness. We present evidence, substantiated by evolutionary theory, demonstrating that fitness is a dynamic environment-dependent property of a phenotype and that oncogenic mutations should have vastly different fitness effects on somatic cells dependent on the tissue microenvironment in an age-dependent manner. Combined, this evidence provides a firm basis for understanding the age-dependent incidence of cancers as driven by age-altered systemic processes regulated above the cell level.},

	abstract = {Hematopoiesis appears to be regulated, in part, by a balance between extracellular positive and negative growth signals. Transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-beta 1) has been shown to be a negative regulator of primitive hematopoietic cells. This study examined the direct effect of TGF-beta 1 on the proliferation and differentiation of long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells (LTR-HSC) in vitro. We previously reported a cell fractionation approach that includes the selection of low Hoescht 33342/low Rhodamine 123 (low Ho/Rh) cell fractions that are highly enriched for long-term repopulating cells (LTR-HSC) and also clone to a very high efficiency in the presence of stem cell factor (SCF) + interleukin-3 (IL-3) + IL-6: 90\% to 100\% of individually cultured low Ho/Rh cells formed high proliferative potential clones. This high cloning efficiency of an LTR-HSC enriched cell population enabled proliferation inhibition studies to be more easily interpreted. In this report, we show that the continuous presence of TGF-beta 1 directly inhibits the cell division of essentially all low Ho/Rh cells (in a dose-dependent manner) during their 0 to 5th cell division in vitro. Therefore, it follows that TGF-beta 1 must directly inhibit the proliferation of LTR-HSC contained within these low Ho/Rh cells. The time required for some low Ho/Rh cells to undergo their first cell division in vitro was also prolonged in the presence of TGF-beta 1. Furthermore, when low Ho/Rh cells were exposed to TFG-beta 1 for varying lengths of time before neutralization of the TGF-beta 1 by monoclonal antibody, the ability to form macroclones was markedly decreased after approximately 4 days of TGF-beta 1 exposure. In addition, 1 to 10 ng/mL of TGF-beta 1 resulted in a maintenance of high proliferative potential-colony-forming cell (HPP-CFC) during 8 days of culture compared with loss of HPP-CFC in cultures with no added TGF-beta 1. In conclusion, this study shows that TGF-beta 1 directly inhibits the initial stages of proliferation of LTR-HSC and appears to slow the differentiation of daughter cells of low Ho/Rh cells.},

However, it is not clear how BMECs balance these dual roles, and whether these events occur at the same vascular site. We found that mammalian bone marrow stem cell maintenance and leukocyte trafficking are regulated by distinct blood vessel types with different permeability properties. Less permeable arterial blood vessels maintain haematopoietic stem cells in a low reactive oxygen species (ROS) state, whereas the more permeable sinusoids promote HSPC activation and are the exclusive site for immature and mature leukocyte trafficking to and from the bone marrow. A functional consequence of high permeability of blood vessels is that exposure to blood plasma increases bone marrow HSPC ROS levels, augmenting their migration and differentiation, while compromising their long-term repopulation and survival.

However, the interactions and influence of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) stem cells with the microenvironment remain largely unexplored. We have unexpectedly found that neuropathy of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) promotes leukemic bone marrow infiltration in an MLL-AF9 AML model. Development of AML disrupts SNS nerves and the quiescence of Nestin(+) niche cells, leading to an expansion of phenotypic MSPCs primed for osteoblastic differentiation at the expense of HSC-maintaining NG2(+) periarteriolar niche cells. Adrenergic signaling promoting leukemogenesis is transduced by the $\beta$2, but not $\beta$3, adrenergic receptor expressed on stromal cells of leukemic bone marrow. These results indicate that sympathetic neuropathy may represent a mechanism for the malignancy in order to co-opt the microenvironment and suggest separate mesenchymal niche activities for malignant and healthy hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow.},

In many cases, this delay is difficult to characterize mathematically through the use of standard pharmacodynamic models. In the present work, we investigated the relationship between methotrexate (MTX) exposure and the time course of MTX effects on tumor cell growth in culture. Two cancer cell lines, Ehrlich ascites cells and sarcoma 180 cells, were exposed for 24 hours to MTX concentrations that varied more than 700-fold (0.19-140 micro g/mL). Viable cells were counted on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 20, 22, and 24 for Ehrlich ascites cells and on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, and 21 for sarcoma 180 cells, through the use of a tetrazolium assay. Although MTX was removed 24 hours after application, cell numbers reached nadir values more than 100 hours after MTX exposure. Data from each cell line were fitted to 3 pharmacodynamic models of chemotherapeutic cell killing: a cell cycle phase-specific model, a phase-nonspecific model, and a transit compartment model (based on the general model recently reported by Mager and Jusko, Clin Pharmacol Ther. 70:210-216, 2001). The transit compartment model captured the data much more accurately than the standard pharmacodynamic models, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.86 to 0.999. This report shows the successful application of a transit compartment model for characterization of the complex time course of chemotherapeutic effects; such models may be very useful in the development of optimization strategies for cancer chemotherapy.},

However, in synchronization experiments, a linear increase in mean mass of a cell population develops over time. A channel is opened for a genetic and growth rate influence extending from grandparent to granddaughter. Positive and negative time correlations close to zero still occurred for mother-daughter cell cycles. The computer program leaves two sites in the cell cycle available for gene, molecular and size checkpoints, one in G1 and one in G2. The simulation experiments bridge the gap between models considering (i) size control, (ii) transition probability, and (iii) inherited properties as interpretations of cell cycle progression and are applicable to embryonic cells with the potential to differentiate, somatic cells, and to the kinetics of activation of serum-starved cells.

Many of the ideas that are now discussed have a long history and much has been underpinned by the earlier studies of teratocarcinomas, and their embryonal carcinoma (EC) stem cells, which present a malignant surrogate for the normal stem cells of the early embryo. Nevertheless, although the potential of EC and ES cells to differentiate into a wide range of tissues is now well attested, little is understood of the key regulatory mechanisms that control their differentiation. Apart from the intrinsic biological interest in elucidating these mechanisms, a clear understanding of the molecular process involved will be essential if the clinical potential of these cells is to be realized. The recent observations of stem-cell plasticity suggest that perhaps our current concepts about the operation of cell regulatory pathways are inadequate, and that new approaches for analysing complex regulatory networks will be essential.},

Here, we identify Mettl3, an N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) transferase, as a regulator for terminating murine naïve pluripotency. Mettl3 knockout pre-implantation epiblasts and naïve embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are depleted for m(6)A in mRNAs and yet, are viable. However, they fail to adequately terminate their naïve state, and subsequently undergo aberrant and restricted lineage priming at the post-implantation stage, leading to early embryonic lethality. m(6)A predominantly and directly reduces mRNA stability, including that of key naïve pluripotency promoting transcripts. This study highlights a critical role for an mRNA epigenetic modification in vivo, and identifies regulatory modules that functionally influence naïve and primed pluripotency in an opposing manner.},

We developed a genome-scale approach–Repli Seq–to map temporally ordered replicating DNA using massively parallel sequencing and applied it to study regional variation in human DNA replication time across multiple human cell types. The method requires as few as 8,000 cytometry-fractionated cells for a single analysis, and provides high-resolution DNA replication patterns with respect to both cell-cycle time and genomic position. We find that different cell types exhibit characteristic replication signatures that reveal striking plasticity in regional replication time patterns covering at least 50\% of the human genome. We also identified autosomal regions with marked biphasic replication timing that include known regions of monoallelic expression as well as many previously uncharacterized domains. Comparison with high-resolution genome-wide profiles of DNaseI sensitivity revealed that DNA replication typically initiates within foci of accessible chromatin comprising clustered DNaseI hypersensitive sites, and that replication time is better correlated with chromatin accessibility than with gene expression. The data collectively provide a unique, genome-wide picture of the epigenetic compartmentalization of the human genome and suggest that cell-lineage specification involves extensive reprogramming of replication timing patterns.},

	abstract = {Cells differentiate when transcription factors bind accessible cis-regulatory elements to establish specific gene expression programs. In differentiating embryonic stem cells, chromatin at lineage-restricted genes becomes sequentially accessible, probably by means of 'pioneer' transcription factor activity, but tissues may use other strategies in vivo. Lateral inhibition is a pervasive process in which one cell forces a different identity on its neighbours, and it is unclear how chromatin in equipotent progenitors undergoing lateral inhibition quickly enables distinct, transiently reversible cell fates. Here we report the chromatin and transcriptional underpinnings of differentiation in mouse small intestine crypts, where notch signalling mediates lateral inhibition to assign progenitor cells into absorptive or secretory lineages. Transcript profiles in isolated LGR5(+) intestinal stem cells and secretory and absorptive progenitors indicated that each cell population was distinct and the progenitors specified. Nevertheless, secretory and absorptive progenitors showed comparable levels of H3K4me2 and H3K27ac histone marks and DNase I hypersensitivity–signifying accessible, permissive chromatin-at most of the same cis-elements. Enhancers acting uniquely in progenitors were well demarcated in LGR5(+) intestinal stem cells, revealing early priming of chromatin for divergent transcriptional programs, and retained active marks well after lineages were specified. On this chromatin background, ATOH1, a secretory-specific transcription factor, controls lateral inhibition through delta-like notch ligand genes and also drives the expression of numerous secretory lineage genes. Depletion of ATOH1 from specified secretory cells converted them into functional enterocytes, indicating prolonged responsiveness of marked enhancers to the presence or absence of a key transcription factor. Thus, lateral inhibition and intestinal crypt lineage plasticity involve interaction of a lineage-restricted transcription factor with broadly permissive chromatin established in multipotent stem cells.},

This regenerative strategy is robust and versatile because relative activator/inhibitor strengths can be modulated easily, adapting the organism to different physiological and evolutionary needs.},

How phosphorylation impacts on the Ire1 splicing activity is unclear. In this study, we isolate distinct phosphorylated species of Ire1 and assess their effects on RNase splicing both in vitro and in vivo. We find that phosphorylation within the kinase activation loop significantly increases RNase splicing in vitro. Correspondingly, mutants of Ire1 that cannot be phosphorylated on the activation loop show decreased specific Xbp1 and promiscuous RNase splicing activity relative to wild-type Ire1 in cells. These data couple the kinase phosphorylation reaction to the activation state of the RNase, suggesting that phosphorylation of the activation loop is an important step in Ire1-mediated UPR activation.},

Analysing the cell population dynamics in the absence of a host immune response we demonstrate a relationship between host and parasite parameters that defines a criterion for the successful invasion and persistence of the parasite. Important parameters are the rates of merozoite production and death and those of erythrocyte production, death and invasion. We present data from experiments designed to evaluate the erythrocyte invasion rate in a rodent malaria system. The model generates patterns of parasitaemia in good qualitative agreement with those seen in Plasmodium berghei infections. The sole force behind the rise and fall in parasitaemia in the model without immunity is the density of susceptible erythrocytes, suggesting that resource availability is an important determinant of the initial pattern of infection in vivo. When we incorporate a simple immune response into the model we find that immunity against the infected cell is much more effective at suppressing parasite abundance than immunity against the merozoite. Simulations reveal oscillating temporal patterns of parasite abundance similar to P. c. chabaudi infection, challenging the concept that antigenic variation is the sole mechanism behind recrudescing patterns of infection.},

We develop a stable and powerful, yet simple, statistical procedure to estimate the size of the whole network from subnet data.

When two cells touch, an adhesion link is created between them by means of transmembrane E-cadherin proteins. Simultaneously, their actin filaments stop polymerizing in the direction perpendicular to the membrane and reorganize to create an apical belt that colocalizes with the adhesion links. Here, we propose a detailed quantitative model of the role of cytoplasmic beta-catenin and alpha-catenin proteins in this process, treated as a reaction-diffusion system. Upon cell-cell contact the concentration in alpha-catenin dimers increases, inhibiting actin branching and thereby reducing cellular motility and expansion pressure. This model provides a mechanism for contact inhibition that could explain previously unrelated experimental findings on the role played by E-cadherin, beta-catenin, and alpha-catenin in the cellular phenotype and in tumorigenesis. In particular, we address the effect of a knockout of the adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor gene. Potential direct tests of our model are discussed.},

Orchestrating the residence times of these factors is therefore important for the well organized functioning of a large network. The classic models of genetic switches sidestep this timing issue by assuming the binding of transcription factors to be governed entirely by thermodynamic protein-DNA affinities. Here we show that relying on passive thermodynamics and random release times can lead to a “time-scale crisis” for master genes that broadcast their signals to a large number of binding sites. We demonstrate that this time-scale crisis for clearance in a large broadcasting network can be resolved by actively regulating residence times through molecular stripping. We illustrate these ideas by studying a model of the stochastic dynamics of the genetic network of the central eukaryotic master regulator \${\textbackslash}textNF{\textbackslash}ensuremath{\textbackslash}kappa{\textbackslash}textB\$ which broadcasts its signals to many downstream genes that regulate immune response, apoptosis, etc.},

	abstract = {Stem cell differentiation has been viewed as coming from transitions between attractors on an epigenetic landscape that governs the dynamics of a regulatory network involving many genes. Rigorous definition of such a landscape is made possible by the realization that gene regulation is stochastic, owing to the small copy number of the transcription factors that regulate gene expression and because of the single-molecule nature of the gene itself. We develop an approximation that allows the quantitative construction of the epigenetic landscape for large realistic model networks. Applying this approach to the network for embryonic stem cell development explains many experimental observations, including the heterogeneous distribution of the transcription factor Nanog and its role in safeguarding the stem cell pluripotency, which can be understood by finding stable steady-state attractors and the most probable transition paths between those attractors. We also demonstrate that the switching rate between attractors can be significantly influenced by the gene expression noise arising from the fluctuations of DNA occupancy when binding to a specific DNA site is slow.},

Although HSCs divide infrequently, it is thought that the entire HSC pool turns over every few weeks, suggesting that HSCs regularly enter and exit cell cycle. Here, we combine flow cytometry with label-retaining assays (BrdU and histone H2B-GFP) to identify a population of dormant mouse HSCs (d-HSCs) within the lin(-)Sca1+cKit+CD150+CD48(-)CD34(-) population. Computational modeling suggests that d-HSCs divide about every 145 days, or five times per lifetime. d-HSCs harbor the vast majority of multilineage long-term self-renewal activity. While they form a silent reservoir of the most potent HSCs during homeostasis, they are efficiently activated to self-renew in response to bone marrow injury or G-CSF stimulation. After re-establishment of homeostasis, activated HSCs return to dormancy, suggesting that HSCs are not stochastically entering the cell cycle but reversibly switch from dormancy to self-renewal under conditions of hematopoietic stress.},

However, the HSC 'niche'–the in vivo regulatory microenvironment where HSCs reside–and the mechanisms involved in controlling the number of adult HSCs remain largely unknown. The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signal has an essential role in inducing haematopoietic tissue during embryogenesis. We investigated the roles of the BMP signalling pathway in regulating adult HSC development in vivo by analysing mutant mice with conditional inactivation of BMP receptor type IA (BMPRIA). Here we show that an increase in the number of spindle-shaped N-cadherin+CD45- osteoblastic (SNO) cells correlates with an increase in the number of HSCs. The long-term HSCs are found attached to SNO cells. Two adherens junction molecules, N-cadherin and beta-catenin, are asymmetrically localized between the SNO cells and the long-term HSCs. We conclude that SNO cells lining the bone surface function as a key component of the niche to support HSCs, and that BMP signalling through BMPRIA controls the number of HSCs by regulating niche size.},

In spite of the persistent and massive reduction of LT-HSCs, steady-state hematopoiesis was unaffected and residual HSCs remained quiescent. Hematopoietic stress, although reported to recruit quiescent HSCs into cycle, was well tolerated by HSPC-depleted mice and did not induce expansion of the small LT-HSC compartment. Only upon 5-Fluorouracil treatment, HSPC-depleted bone marrow was compromised in re-constituting hematopoiesis, demonstrating that HSCs and early progenitors are crucial to compensate myeloablation. Hence, a contracted HSC compartment cannot recover in situ to its original size and normal steady-state blood cell generation is sustained with less than 10\% of normal LT-HSC numbers without increased contribution of the few residual cells.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Tumors are heterogeneous, evolving ecosystems, composed of sub-populations of neoplastic cells that follow distinct strategies for survival and propagation. The success of a strategy defining any single neoplastic sub-population is dependent on the distribution of other strategies, and on various components of the tumour microenvironment like cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs). The rules mapping the population9s strategy distribution to the fitness of individual strategies can be represented as an evolutionary game. In four different environments, we measure the games between treatment naive (Alectinib therapy sensitive) cells and a derivative line in which resistance was previously evolved. We find that the games are not only qualitatively different between different environments, but that targeted therapy and the presence of CAFs qualitatively switch the type of game being played. This provides the first empirical confirmation for the theoretical postulate of evolutionary game theory (EGT) in mathematical oncology that we can treat not just the player, but also the game. Although we concentrate on measuring games played by cancer cells, the measurement methodology we develop can be used to advance the study of games in other microscopic systems.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) is a widely employed metaphor for problems associated with the evolution of cooperative behavior. We have recently proposed an alternative approach to the PD, by exploring "spatial games" in which players–who are either pure cooperators, C, or pure defectors, D–interact with neighbors in some spatial array; in each generation, players add up the scores from all encounters, and in the next generation a given cell is retained by its previous owner or taken over by a neighbor, depending on who has the largest score. Over a wide range of the relevant parameters, we find that C and D persist together indefinitely (without any of the complex strategies that remember past encounters, and anticipate future ones, which characterize essentially all previous work on the iterated PD). Our earlier work, however, dealt with symmetric spatial lattices in two dimensions, deterministic winning and discrete time. We show here that the essential results remain valid in more realistic situations where the spatial distributions of cells are random in two or three dimensions, and where winning is partly probabilistic (rather than being determined by the largest local total). The essential results also remain valid (pace Huberman and Glance [Huberman, B. A. \& Glance, N. S. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90, 7716-7718]) when interactions occur in continuous rather than discrete time.},

These methods are called complete data methods because they make use of data from all arrays in an experiment to form the normalizing relation. These algorithms are compared to two methods that make use of a baseline array: a one number scaling based algorithm and a method that uses a non-linear normalizing relation by comparing the variability and bias of an expression measure. Two publicly available datasets are used to carry out the comparisons. The simplest and quickest complete data method is found to perform favorably.

Therefore, inhibiting angiogenesis remains a viable strategy for cancer therapy. However, anti-angiogenic therapy has not proved to be effective in reducing tumor growth across a wide range of tumors, and no reliable predictive biomarkers have been found to determine the efficacy of anti-angiogenic treatment. Using our previously established computational model of tumor-bearing mice, we sought to determine whether tumor growth kinetic parameters could be used to predict the outcome of anti-angiogenic treatment. A model trained with datasets from six \textit{in vivo} mice studies was used to generate a randomized \textit{in silico} tumor-bearing mouse population. We analyzed tumor growth in untreated mice (control) and mice treated with an anti-angiogenic agent and determined the Kaplan-Meier survival estimates based on simulated tumor volume data. We found that the ratio between two kinetic parameters, \textit{k$_{\textrm{0}}$} and \textit{k$_{\textrm{1}}$}, which characterize the tumor9s exponential and linear growth rates, as well as \textit{k$_{\textrm{1}}$} alone, can be used as prognostic biomarkers of population survival outcome. Our work demonstrates a robust, quantitative approach for identifying tumor growth kinetic parameters as prognostic biomarkers and serves as a template that can be used to identify other biomarkers for anti-angiogenic treatment.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The transcription factor Ascl2 (a Wnt target gene) is a master regulator of intestinal stem cell identity. It is unclear how the continuous Wnt gradient along the crypt axis is translated into discrete expression of Ascl2 and discrete specification of stem cells at crypt bottoms. We show that (1) Ascl2 is regulated in a direct autoactivatory loop, leading to a distinct on/off expression pattern, and (2) Wnt/R-spondin can activate this regulatory loop. This mechanism interprets the Wnt levels in the intestinal crypt and translates the continuous Wnt signal into a discrete Ascl2 "on" or "off" decision. In turn, Ascl2, together with $\beta$-catenin/Tcf, activates the genes fundamental to the stem cell state. In this manner, Ascl2 forms a transcriptional switch that is both Wnt responsive and Wnt dependent to define stem cell identity.},

Here, we derive dynamic gene regulatory networks for human myeloid differentiation using a 5-day time series of RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data. We profile HL-60 promyelocytes differentiating into macrophages, neutrophils, monocytes, and monocyte-derived macrophages. We find a rapid response in the expression of key transcription factors and lineage markers that only regulate a subset of their targets at a given time, which is followed by chromatin accessibility changes that occur later along with further gene expression changes. We observe differences between promyelocyte- and monocyte-derived macrophages at both the transcriptional and chromatin landscape level, despite using the same differentiation stimulus, which suggest that the path taken by cells in the differentiation landscape defines their end cell state. More generally, our approach of combining neighboring time points and replicates to achieve greater sequencing depth can efficiently infer footprint-based regulatory networks from long series data.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Blood cell formation is maintained by the replication of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) that continuously feed downstream "compartments" where amplification and differentiation of cells occurs, giving rise to all blood lineages. Whereas HSC replicate slowly, committed cells replicate faster as they become more differentiated. METHODOLOGY/SIGNIFICANT FINDING: We propose a multi-compartment model of hematopoiesis, designed on the principle of cell flow conservation under stationary conditions. Cells lost from one compartment due to differentiation are replaced by cells from the upstream compartment. We assume that there is a constant relationship between cell input and output in each compartment and fix the single parameter of the model using data available for granulocyte maturation. We predict that approximately 31 mitotic events separate the HSC from the mature cells observed in the circulation. Besides estimating the number of compartments, our model allows us to estimate the size of each compartment, the rate of cell replication within each compartment, the mean time a given cell type contributes to hematopoiesis, the amplification rate in each compartment, as well as the mean time separating stem-cell replication and mature blood-cell formation. CONCLUSIONS:Despite its simplicity, the model agrees with the limited in vivo data available and can make testable predictions. In particular, our prediction of the average lifetime of a PIG-A mutated clone agrees closely with the experimental results available for the PIG-A gene mutation in healthy adults. The present elucidation of the compartment structure and dynamics of hematopoiesis may prove insightful in further understanding a variety of hematopoietic disorders.},

	abstract = {To test the hypothesis that lecturing maximizes learning and course performance, we metaanalyzed 225 studies that reported data on examination scores or failure rates when comparing student performance in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses under traditional lecturing versus active learning. The effect sizes indicate that on average, student performance on examinations and concept inventories increased by 0.47 SDs under active learning (n = 158 studies), and that the odds ratio for failing was 1.95 under traditional lecturing (n = 67 studies). These results indicate that average examination scores improved by about 6\% in active learning sections, and that students in classes with traditional lecturing were 1.5 times more likely to fail than were students in classes with active learning. Heterogeneity analyses indicated that both results hold across the STEM disciplines, that active learning increases scores on concept inventories more than on course examinations, and that active learning appears effective across all class sizes-although the greatest effects are in small (n \${\textbackslash}le\$ 50) classes. Trim and fill analyses and fail-safe n calculations suggest that the results are not due to publication bias. The results also appear robust to variation in the methodological rigor of the included studies, based on the quality of controls over student quality and instructor identity. This is the largest and most comprehensive metaanalysis of undergraduate STEM education published to date. The results raise questions about the continued use of traditional lecturing as a control in research studies, and support active learning as the preferred, empirically validated teaching practice in regular classrooms.},

	abstract = {Author Summary DNA double-strand breaks occur during metabolism, DNA replication and by exposure to exogenous sources such as ionising radiation. When the genome is inflicted with this type of damage, DNA repair machinery is promoted to restore genome structure. The efficient interplay between DNA damage and repair is crucial to genome stability because the choice of repair mechanism directly affects the probability of mutation. Multiple mechanisms of DNA repair are known to exist, however, the subtleties of how they are activated and their interactions are yet to be fully determined. We hypothesise that a combination of Bayesian statistics and mathematical modeling is essential to elucidate the network dynamics. Studies in the literature have presented time series data of double-strand break repair in wild type and mutant cells. By combining existing time series data, our modeling approach can quantify the differences in activation amongst mutants and in addition identify a number of novel insights into the dynamics of the competing mechanisms. We conclude that alternative mechanisms of repair exhibit variable dynamics dependent on the levels of individual recruitment proteins of the predominant repair pathways.},

Yet how they control gene expression in single cells, quantitatively and over time, remains unclear. We used time-lapse microscopy to analyze the dynamic effects of four silencers associated with diverse modifications: DNA methylation, histone deacetylation, and histone methylation. For all regulators, silencing and reactivation occurred in all-or-none events, enabling the regulators to modulate the fraction of cells silenced rather than the amount of gene expression. These dynamics could be described by a three-state model involving stochastic transitions between active, reversibly silent, and irreversibly silent states. Through their individual transition rates, these regulators operate over different time scales and generate distinct types of epigenetic memory.

The implication of this concept is that cancer progression may be understood, and predicted, with mathematical models of motion of the transcriptome in a low-dimensional projection that can be constructed to retain a maximal amount of relevant information in the system. We use a genetic mouse model of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) to demonstrate the concepts of our mathematical model.

We use these data to link regulatory elements to their target genes, to define the transcription factor grammar specifying each cell type, and to discover \textit{in vivo} correlates of heterogeneity in accessibility within cell types. We develop a technique for mapping single cell gene expression data to single-cell chromatin accessibility data, facilitating the comparison of atlases.

In contrast, the precise role of EMT-related processes in tumors originating from mesenchymal tissues, such as bone and soft-tissues sarcomas, is still largely unclear. In fact, although the existence of the EMT in sarcomas appears paradoxical because these cancers are, by definition, mesenchymal \textit{ab initio}, accumulating evidence suggests that many sarcomas can undergo EMT-related processes, which may be associated with aggressive clinical behavior. These processes may be especially operative in certain sarcoma subtypes, such as carcinosarcomas displaying a biphenotypic morphology with characteristics of both mesenchymal and epithelial tumors. In this review, we discuss findings regarding the potential existence of EMT-related processes in sarcomas and propose that sarcomas can reside in a metastable state, enabling them to become either more mesenchymal or epithelial under specific conditions, which likely has important clinical implications. \textit{Cancer Res; 77(17); 4556–61. ©2017 AACR}.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

GDNF/RET signaling is required for ureter and kidney development, and cells lacking Ret are excluded from the tips of the branching ureteric bud in chimeric kidneys. Here, we find that this exclusion results from earlier Ret-dependent cell rearrangements in the caudal Wolffian duct, which generate a specialized epithelial domain that later emerges as the tip of the primary ureteric bud. By juxtaposing cells with elevated or reduced RET activity, we find that Wolffian duct cells compete, based on RET signaling levels, to contribute to this domain. At the same time, the caudal Wolffian duct transiently converts from a simple to a pseudostratified epithelium, a process that does not require Ret. Thus, both Ret-dependent cell movements and Ret-independent changes in the Wolffian duct epithelium contribute to ureteric bud formation.},

	abstract = {Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and its reverse - Mesenchymal to Epithelial Transition (MET) - are hallmarks of cellular plasticity during embryonic development and cancer metastasis. During EMT, epithelial cells lose cell-cell adhesion and gain migratory and invasive traits either partially or completely, leading to a hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (hybrid E/M) or a mesenchymal phenotype respectively. Mesenchymal cells move individually, but hybrid E/M cells migrate collectively as observed during gastrulation, wound healing, and the formation of tumor clusters detected as Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs). Typically, the hybrid E/M phenotype has largely been tacitly assumed to be transient and 'metastable'. Here, we identify certain 'phenotypic stability factors' (PSFs) such as GRHL2 that couple to the core EMT decision-making circuit (miR-200/ZEB) and stabilize hybrid E/M phenotype. Further, we show that H1975 lung cancer cells can display a stable hybrid E/M phenotype and migrate collectively, a behavior that is impaired by knockdown of GRHL2 and another previously identified PSF - OVOL. In addition, our computational model predicts that GRHL2 can also associate hybrid E/M phenotype with high tumor-initiating potential, a prediction strengthened by the observation that the higher levels of these PSFs may be predictive of poor patient outcome. Finally, based on these specific examples, we deduce certain network motifs that can stabilize the hybrid E/M phenotype. Our results suggest that partial EMT, i.e. a hybrid E/M phenotype, need not be 'metastable', and strengthen the emerging notion that partial EMT, but not necessarily a complete EMT, is associated with aggressive tumor progression.},

In both instances, binary cell fate decisions are often determined by toggle switches, in which two master regulators compete to define one of two possible cell states. However, much less is known about multistate transitions due to the lack of experimentally tractable systems. Here, we demonstrate that the fungal pathogen Candida tropicalis undergoes reversible and heritable transitions between three stable cell states. We propose that tristability is achieved by a symmetric self-activating toggle switch and test this model by ectopic expression of the two master transcription factors. Significantly, manipulating the expression of the two master regulators induced all six possible state-to-state transitions in the tristable system. Furthermore, we found that stable inheritance of transcriptionally induced states only occurred if combined with inhibition of a histone deacetylase activity. Together, these results define the genetic regulation of a tristable switch and demonstrate that synergistic genetic cues (one transcriptional and one chromatin-based) drive epigenetic inheritance in a unicellular species. We also discuss striking parallels between cell fate decisions in yeast and the regulation of cell differentiation events in higher eukaryotes.},

Here, we present a spatio-temporal analysis of the cell dynamics using transition matrices, which provide information of the type of cell migration. We find evidence that leukocytes exhibit types of migratory behaviour, which differ from previously described random walk processes. Dimethyl sulfoxide treatment decreased the level of persistence at early time points after wounding and ablated temporal dependencies observed in untreated embryos. We then use pharmacological inhibition of p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase mitogen-activated protein kinases to determine their effects on in vivo leukocyte migration patterns and discuss how they modify the characteristics of the cell migration process. In particular, we find that their respective inhibition leads to decreased and increased levels of persistent motion in leukocytes following wounding.

Here, we characterized the intracellular dynamics of PVs and PYRs during spontaneous and visually evoked gamma activity in layers 2/3 of V1 of awake mice using targeted patch-clamp recordings and synchronous local field potentials (LFPs). Strong gamma activity patterned in short bouts (one to three cycles), occurred when PVs and PYRs were depolarizing and entrained their membrane potential dynamics regardless of the presence of visual stimulation. PV firing phase locked unconditionally to gamma activity. However, PYRs only phase locked to visually evoked gamma bouts.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:In the Southeast United States, African Americans have an estimated incidence of hypertension and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) that is five times greater than Caucasians. Higher rates of low birth weight (LBW) among African Americans is suggested to predispose African Americans to the higher risk, possibly by reducing the number of glomeruli that develop in the kidney. This study investigates the relationships between age, race, gender, total glomerular number (Nglom), mean glomerular volume (Vglom), body surface area (BSA), and birth weight. METHODS:Stereologic estimates of Nglom and Vglom were obtained using the physical disector/fractionator combination for autopsy kidneys from 37 African Americans and 19 Caucasians. RESULTS:Nglom was normally distributed and ranged from 227,327 to 1,825,380, an 8.0-fold difference. A direct linear relationship was observed between Nglom and birth weight (r = 0.423, P = 0.0012) with a regression coefficient that predicted an increase of 257,426 glomeruli per kilogram increase in birth weight (alpha = 0.050:0.908). Among adults there was a 4.9-fold range in Vglom, and in adults, Vglom was strongly and inversely correlated with Nglom (r =-0.640, P = 0.000002). Adult Vglom showed no significant correlation with BSA for males (r = -0.0150, P = 0.936), although it did for females (r = 0.606, P = 0.022). No racial differences in average Nglom or Vglom were observed. CONCLUSION:Birth weight is a strong determinant of Nglom and thereby of glomerular size in the postnatal kidney. The findings support the hypothesis that LBW by impairing nephron development is a risk factor for hypertension and ESRD in adulthood.},

In pursuing a mechanistic understanding behind such complexity, we constructed a core molecular–cellular interaction network underlying CRC and investigated its nonlinear dynamical properties. The hypothesis and modelling method has been developed previously and tested in various cancer studies. The network dynamics reveal a landscape of several attractive basins corresponding to both normal intestinal phenotype and robust tumour subtypes, identified by their different molecular signatures. Comparison between the modelling results and gene expression profiles from patients collected at the second affiliated hospital of Zhejiang University is presented as validation. The numerical ‘driving’ experiment suggests that CRC pathogenesis may depend on pathways involved in gastrointestinal track development and molecules associated with mesenchymal lineage differentiation, such as Stat5, BMP, retinoic acid signalling pathways, Runx and Hox transcription families. We show that the multi-faceted response to immune stimulation and therapies, as well as different carcinogenesis and metastasis routes, can be straightforwardly understood and analysed under such a framework.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Acute myeloid leukemia with mutated NPM1 gene and aberrant cytoplasmic expression of nucleophosmin (NPMc+ acute myeloid leukemia) shows distinctive biological and clinical features. Experimental evidence of the oncogenic potential of the nucleophosmin mutant is, however, still lacking, and it is unclear whether other genetic lesion(s), e.g. FLT3 internal tandem duplication, cooperate with NPM1 mutations in acute myeloid leukemia development. An analysis of age-specific incidence, together with mathematical modeling of acute myeloid leukemia epidemiology, can help to uncover the number of genetic events needed to cause leukemia. We collected data on age at diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia patients from five European Centers in Germany, The Netherlands and Italy, and determined the age-specific incidence of AML with mutated NPM1 (a total of 1,444 cases) for each country. Linear regression of the curves representing age-specific rates of diagnosis per year showed similar slopes of about 4 on a double logarithmic scale. We then adapted a previously designed mathematical model of hematopoietic tumorigenesis to analyze the age incidence of acute myeloid leukemia with mutated NPM1 and found that a one-mutation model can explain the incidence curve of this leukemia entity. This model fits with the hypothesis that NPMc+ acute myeloid leukemia arises from an NPM1 mutation with haploinsufficiency of the wild-type NPM1 allele.},

The robustness of this account was evident in a large-scale replication involving 18,420 participants.

Here, we use a translucent zebrafish larval model of Ras(G12V)-driven neoplasia to image the interactions between inflammatory cells drawn to a wound, and to adjacent pre-neoplastic cells. We show that neutrophils are rapidly diverted from a wound to pre-neoplastic cells and these interactions lead to increased proliferation of the pre-neoplastic cells. One of the wound-inflammation-induced trophic signals is prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). In an adult model of chronic wounding in zebrafish, we show that repeated wounding with subsequent inflammation leads to a greater incidence of local melanoma formation. Our zebrafish studies led us to investigate the innate immune cell associations in ulcerated melanomas in human patients. We find a strong correlation between neutrophil presence at sites of melanoma ulceration and cell proliferation at these sites, which is associated with poor prognostic outcome.},

	abstract = {Author Summary The eukaryotic cell division cycle is driven by fluctuating activities of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk), which are activated and inactivated by several mechanisms, including cyclin synthesis and degradation. Although the cell cycle is driven by many different Cdk-cyclin complexes in present-day eukaryotes, experiments with fission yeast demonstrate that a single Cdk-cyclin complex is sufficient to order the events of the cell cycle. Surprisingly, a Cdk-inhibitory mechanism working through tyrosine phosphorylation of the kinase subunit, which is essential for modern fission yeast, becomes dispensable in the Minimal Cdk Network (MCN). By developing both deterministic and stochastic models of the MCN, we show that a different inhibitory mechanism based on a stoichiometric Cdk inhibitor (called Rum1) can compensate for the lack of inhibitory Cdk phosphorylation in the MCN. We also demonstrate that this compensation mechanism is suppressed in wild-type fission yeast cells by the other Cdk-cyclin complexes, which down-regulate the level of Rum1. These predictions of computational modelling are supported by our experimental data. Our work provides new insights into the interplay between the structure of the control network and the physiology of the cell cycle.},

	abstract = {c-kit is expressed on hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells, but not on lymphohematopoietic differentiated cells. Lineage marker-negative, c-kit-positive (Lin-c-kit+) bone marrow cells were fractionated by means of Ly6A/E or Sca-1 expression. Lin-c-kit+Sca-1+ cells, which consisted of 0.08\% of bone marrow nucleated cells, did not contain day-8 colony-forming units-spleen (CFU-S), but 80\% were day-12 CFU-S. One hundred cells rescued the lethally irradiated mice and reconstituted hematopoiesis. On the other hand, 2 x 10(3) of Lin-c-kit+Sca-1- cells formed 20 day-8 and 11 day-12 spleen colonies, but they could not rescue the lethally irradiated mice. These data indicate that Lin-c-kit+Sca-1+ cells are primitive hematopoietic stem cells and that Sca-1-cells do not contain stem cells that reconstitute hematopoiesis. Lin-c-kit+Sca-1+ cells formed no colonies in the presence of stem cell factor (SCF) or interleukin-6 (IL-6), and only 10\% of them formed colonies in the presence of IL-3. However, approximately 50\% of them formed large colonies in the presence of IL-3, IL-6, and SCF. Moreover, when single cells were deposited into culture medium by fluorescence-activated cell sorter clone sorting system, 40\% of them proliferated on a stromal cell line (PA-6) and proliferated for more than 2 weeks. In contrast, 15\% of the Lin-c-kit+Sca-1-cells formed colonies in the presence of IL-3, but no synergistic effects were observed in combination with SCF plus IL-6 and/or IL-3. Approximately 10\% proliferated on PA-6, but most of them degenerated within 2 weeks. The population ratio of c-kit+Sca-1+ to c-kit+Sca-1- increased 2 and 4 days after exposure to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). These results are consistent with the relative enrichment of highly proliferative colony-forming cells by 5-FU. These data show that, although c-kit is found both on the primitive hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors, Sca-1+ cells are more primitive and respond better than Sca-1- cells to a combination of hematopoietic factors, including SCF and stromal cells.},

Recent developments in experimental technologies have made it possible to measure the numbers of transcripts and protein molecules in single cells. Although estimation methods based on deterministic models have been proposed aimed at evaluating kinetic rates from experimental observations, these methods cannot tackle noise in gene expression that may arise from discrete processes of gene expression, small numbers of mRNA transcript, fluctuations in the activity of transcriptional factors and variability in the experimental environment. RESULTS:In this paper, we develop effective methods for estimating kinetic rates in genetic regulatory networks. The simulated maximum likelihood method is used to evaluate parameters in stochastic models described by either stochastic differential equations or discrete biochemical reactions. Different types of non-parametric density functions are used to measure the transitional probability of experimental observations. For stochastic models described by biochemical reactions, we propose to use the simulated frequency distribution to evaluate the transitional density based on the discrete nature of stochastic simulations. The genetic optimization algorithm is used as an efficient tool to search for optimal reaction rates. Numerical results indicate that the proposed methods can give robust estimations of kinetic rates with good accuracy.},

	abstract = {Home ranges (HRs) are a remarkably common form of animal space use, but we still lack an integrated view of the individual-level processes that can lead to their emergence and maintenance, particularly when individuals are in competition for resources. We built a spatially explicit mechanistic movement model to investigate how simple memory-based foraging rules may enable animals to establish HRs and to what extent this increases their foraging efficiency compared to individuals that do not base foraging decisions on memory. We showed that these simple rules enable individuals to perform better than individuals using the most efficient strategy that does not rely on memory and drive them to spatially segregate through avoidance of resource patches used by others. This striking result questions the common assumption that low HR overlaps are indicators of territorial behavior. Indeed, it appears that, by using an information-updating system, individuals can keep their environment relatively predictable without paying the cost of defending an exclusive space. However, memory-based foraging strategies leading to HR emergence seem unable to prevent the disruptive effects of the arrival of new individuals. This calls for further research on the mechanisms that can stabilize HR spatial organization in the long term.},

The immersed boundary method is used to model the cell membrane and cortex with cadherin binding forces added as linear springs. The simulations indicate that cells in suspension can develop normal cell-cell contacts without actin-based cadherin anchoring or membrane protrusions. The cadherins can be fixed in the membrane or free to move, and the end results are similar.

	abstract = {Abnormal metabolism is a hallmark of cancer, yet its regulation remains poorly understood. Cancer cells were considered to utilize primarily glycolysis for ATP production, referred to as the Warburg effect. However, recent evidence suggests that oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) plays a crucial role during cancer progression. Here we utilized a systems biology approach to decipher the regulatory principle of glycolysis and OXPHOS. Integrating information from literature, we constructed a regulatory network of genes and metabolites, from which we extracted a core circuit containing HIF-1, AMPK, and ROS. Our circuit analysis showed that while normal cells have an oxidative state and a glycolytic state, cancer cells can access a hybrid state with both metabolic modes coexisting. This was due to higher ROS production and/or oncogene activation, such as RAS, MYC, and c-SRC. Guided by the model, we developed two signatures consisting of AMPK and HIF-1 downstream genes, respectively, to quantify the activity of glycolysis and OXPHOS. By applying the AMPK and HIF-1 signatures to The Cancer Genome Atlas patient transcriptomics data of multiple cancer types and single-cell RNA-seq data of lung adenocarcinoma, we confirmed an anticorrelation between AMPK and HIF-1 activities and the association of metabolic states with oncogenes. We propose that the hybrid phenotype contributes to metabolic plasticity, allowing cancer cells to adapt to various microenvironments. Using model simulations, our theoretical framework of metabolism can serve as a platform to decode cancer metabolic plasticity and design cancer therapies targeting metabolism.

In this chapter we use the Wnt pathway to showcase current mathematical and statistical techniques that enable modelers to gain insight into (models of) gene regulation and generate testable predictions. We introduce a range of modeling frameworks, but focus on ordinary differential equation (ODE) models since they remain the most widely used approach in systems biology and medicine and continue to offer great potential. We present methods for the analysis of a single model, comprising applications of standard dynamical systems approaches such as nondimensionalization, steady state, asymptotic and sensitivity analysis, and more recent statistical and algebraic approaches to compare models with data. We present parameter estimation and model comparison techniques, focusing on Bayesian analysis and coplanarity via algebraic geometry. Our intention is that this (non-exhaustive) review may serve as a useful starting point for the analysis of models in systems medicine.},

	abstract = {Chemical reaction systems are dynamical systems that arise in chemical engineering and systems biology. In this work, we consider the question of whether the minimal (in a precise sense) multistationary chemical reaction networks, which we propose to call `atoms of multistationarity,' characterize the entire set of multistationary networks. Our main result states that the answer to this question is `yes' in the context of fully open continuous-flow stirred-tank reactors (CFSTRs), which are networks in which all chemical species take part in the inflow and outflow. In order to prove this result, we show that if a subnetwork admits multiple steady states, then these steady states can be lifted to a larger network, provided that the two networks share the same stoichiometric subspace. We also prove an analogous result when a smaller network is obtained from a larger network by `removing species.' Our results provide the mathematical foundation for a technique used by Siegal-Gaskins et al. of establishing bistability by way of `network ancestry.' Additionally, our work provides sufficient conditions for establishing multistationarity by way of atoms and moreover reduces the problem of classifying multistationary CFSTRs to that of cataloging atoms of multistationarity. As an application, we enumerate and classify all 386 bimolecular and reversible two-reaction networks. Of these, exactly 35 admit multiple positive steady states. Moreover, each admits a unique minimal multistationary subnetwork, and these subnetworks form a poset (with respect to the relation of `removing species') which has 11 minimal elements (the atoms of multistationarity).},

Here we present a framework for constructing exact solutions of PDE models of reactive transport. Our approach is relevant for advection-dominant problems, and is based on a regular perturbation technique. We present a description of the solution technique for a range of one-dimensional scenarios involving constant and variable coefficients, and we show that the solutions compare well with numerical approximations. Our general approach applies to a range of initial conditions and various forms of v(x) and k(x). Instead of simply documenting specific solutions for particular cases, we present a symbolic worksheet, as supplementary material, which enables the solution to be evaluated for different choices of the initial condition, v(x) and k(x). We also discuss how the technique generalizes to apply to models of coupled multispecies reactive transport as well as higher dimensional problems.},

Proteins often undergo double phosphorylation, which can occur through two possible mechanisms: distributive or processive. Which phosphorylation mechanism is chosen for a particular cellular regulation bears biological significance, and it is therefore in our interest to understand these mechanisms. In this paper we study dynamics of the MEK/ERK phosphorylation. We employ a model selection algorithm based on approximate Bayesian computation to elucidate phosphorylation dynamics from quantitative time course data obtained from PC12 cells in vivo. The algorithm infers the posterior distribution over four proposed models for phosphorylation and dephosphorylation dynamics, and this distribution indicates the amount of support given to each model. We evaluate the robustness of our inferential framework by systematically exploring different ways of parameterizing the models and for different prior specifications. The models with the highest inferred posterior probability are the two models employing distributive dephosphorylation, whereas we are unable to choose decisively between the processive and distributive phosphorylation mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Polynomial dynamical systems are widely used to model and study real phenomena. In biochemistry, they are the preferred choice for modelling the concentration of chemical species in reaction networks with mass-action kinetics. These systems are typically parameterised by many (unknown) parameters. A goal is to understand how properties of the dynamical systems depend on the parameters. Qualitative properties relating to the behaviour of a dynamical system are locally inferred from the system at steady state. Here we focus on steady states that are the positive solutions to a parameterised system of generalised polynomial equations. In recent years, methods from computational algebra have been developed to understand these solutions, but our knowledge is limited: for example, we cannot efficiently decide how many positive solutions the system has as a function of the parameters. Even deciding whether there is one or more solutions is non-trivial. We present a new method, based on so-called injectivity, to preclude or assert that multiple positive solutions exist. The results apply to generalised polynomials and variables can be restricted to the linear, parameter-independent first integrals of the dynamical system. The method has been tested in a wide range of systems.},

Recent attempts to identify the leukemia stem-like cells (LSC) have also indicated heterogeneity of these cells. On the basis of mathematical modeling and computer simulations, we have provided evidence that proliferation and self-renewal rates of the LSC population have greater impact on the course of disease than proliferation and self-renewal rates of leukemia blast populations, that is, leukemia progenitor cells. The modeling approach has enabled us to estimate the LSC properties of 31 individuals with relapsed AML and to link them to patient survival. On the basis of the estimated LSC properties, the patients can be divided into two prognostic groups that differ significantly with respect to overall survival after first relapse. The results suggest that high LSC self-renewal and proliferation rates are indicators of poor prognosis. Nevertheless, high LSC self-renewal rate may partially compensate for slow LSC proliferation and vice versa. Thus, model-based interpretation of clinical data allows estimation of prognostic factors that cannot be measured directly. This may have clinical implications for designing treatment strategies.},

The tortuosity of an oriented path is inversely related to the efficiency of the orientation mechanism involved, the best mechanism being assumed to allow the animal to reach its goal along a straight line movement. The tortuosity of a random search path controls the local searching intensity, allowing the animal to adjust its search effort to the local profitability of the environment. This paper shows that (1) the efficiency of an oriented path can be reliably estimated by a straightness index computed as the ratio between the distance from the starting point to the goal and the path length travelled to reach the goal, but such a simple index, ranging between 0 and 1, cannot be applied to random search paths; (2) the tortuosity of a random search path, ranging between straight line movement and Brownian motion, can be reliably estimated by a sinuosity index which combines the mean cosine of changes of direction with the mean step length; and (3) in the current state of the art, the fractal analysis of animals' paths, which may appear as an alternative and promising way to measure the tortuosity of a random search path as a fractal dimension ranging between 1 (straight line movement) and 2 (Brownian motion), is only liable to generate artifactual results. This paper also provides some help for distinguishing between oriented and random search paths, and depicts a general, comprehensive framework for analysing individual animals' paths in a two-dimensional space.},

Attention focuses on the stability of radially symmetric model solutions to perturbations involving spherical harmonics Ylm (theta, phi). Linear theory is used to identify bifurcation points at which the radially symmetric steady state loses stability. The first modes to become unstable are shown to correspond to the l = 2 spherical harmonics. Results from group theory and weakly nonlinear analysis indicate the structure of the l = 2 bifurcation point is a transcritical bifurcation in which all nontrivial solution branches are unstable. By proceeding to third order and focusing on a special set of parameter values for which the quadratic terms are negligible, it is shown that the system's behaviour in a neighbourhood of the l = 2 bifurcation point is governed by a subcritical bifurcation. In consequence, the nontrivial asymmetric solution branches in a neighbourhood of the bifurcation point are unstable. The branches of asymmetric solutions bound the domain of attraction of the radially symmetric tumour configuration where it is locally stable. The analytical results that are derived lead us to conjecture that any stable asymmetric tumour structures will involve spherical harmonics of order l {\textgreater} or = 3.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Mechanical and biophysical properties of the cellular microenvironment regulate cell fate decisions. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) fate is influenced by past mechanical dosing (memory), but the mechanisms underlying this process have not yet been well defined. We have yet to understand how memory affects specific cell fate decisions, such as the differentiation of MSCs into neurons, adipocytes, myocytes, and osteoblasts. RESULTS:We study a minimal gene regulatory network permissive of multi-lineage MSC differentiation into four cell fates. We present a continuous model that is able to describe the cell fate transitions that occur during differentiation, and analyze its dynamics with tools from multistability, bifurcation, and cell fate landscape analysis, and via stochastic simulation. Whereas experimentally, memory has only been observed during osteogenic differentiation, this model predicts that memory regions can exist for each of the four MSC-derived cell lineages. We can predict the substrate stiffness ranges over which memory drives differentiation; these are directly testable in an experimental setting. Furthermore, we quantitatively predict how substrate stiffness and culture duration co-regulate the fate of a stem cell, and we find that the feedbacks from the differentiating MSC onto its substrate are critical to preserve mechanical memory. Strikingly, we show that re-seeding MSCs onto a sufficiently soft substrate increases the number of cell fates accessible. CONCLUSIONS:Control of MSC differentiation is crucial for the success of much-lauded regenerative therapies based on MSCs. We have predicted new memory regions that will directly impact this control, and have quantified the size of the memory region for osteoblasts, as well as the co-regulatory effects on cell fates of substrate stiffness and culture duration. Taken together, these results can be used to develop novel strategies to better control the fates of MSCs in vitro and following transplantation.},

Although much progress has been made over the years in identifying the functions of the different cell types of the thymic stromal compartment, there is no comprehensive characterization of their diversity and heterogeneity. Here we combined massively parallel single-cell RNA-sequencing4,5, spatial mapping, chromatin profiling and gene targeting to characterize de novo the entire stromal compartment of the mouse thymus. We identified dozens of cell states, with thymic epithelial cells (TECs) showing the highest degree of heterogeneity. Our analysis highlights four major medullary TEC (mTEC I–IV) populations, with distinct molecular functions, epigenetic landscapes and lineage regulators. Specifically, mTEC IV constitutes a new and highly divergent TEC lineage with molecular characteristics of the gut chemosensory epithelial tuft cells. Mice deficient in Pou2f3, a master regulator of tuft cells, have complete and specific depletion of mTEC IV cells, which results in increased levels of thymus-resident type-2 innate lymphoid cells. Overall, our study provides a comprehensive characterization of the thymic stroma and identifies a new tuft-like TEC population, which is critical for shaping the immune niche in the thymus.},

Activity of both types of cellular regulators is often dependent on their abundance and is determined by the rate of proteolysis via the ubiquitin pathway. Aberrations in ubiquitin-dependent degradation of regulatory proteins frequently occur in human cancers including malignant melanoma. Melanoma cells that re-program ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis toward accelerated degradation of protein regulators of tumor suppression and abnormal stabilization of oncogenic proteins are likely to gain an advantage in growth and survival. Specific characteristics of melanoma biology include rapid metastasizing and resistance to conventional anticancer therapy. Exploration of these traits should place an emphasis on a subset of the signal transduction pathways that are governed by a number of key protein regulators whose stability and activity becomes deregulated during progression of malignant melanoma. Targeting the ubiquitination and degradation of these pivotal proteins may provide a promising new therapeutic approach to treatment of this disease.},

Developing a quantitative understanding of the regulatory pathways that guide stem cell behavior will be vital to understanding how these systems change under conditions of stress, inflammation, and cancer initiation. Predictions from mathematical modeling can be used as a clinical tool to guide therapy design. We present a survey of mathematical models used to study stem cell population dynamics and stem cell niche regulation, both in the hematopoietic system and other tissues. Highlighting the quantitative aspects of stem cell biology, we describe compelling questions that can be addressed with modeling.

The Wnt pathway component Axin acts as an essential scaffold for the assembly of both complexes. How the $\beta$-catenin destruction and LRP6 signaling complexes are modulated following Wnt stimulation remains controversial. A recent study in Science by He and coworkers reveals an underlying logic for Wnt pathway control in which Axin phosphorylation toggles a switch between the active and inactive states. This mini-review focuses on this and two other recent studies that provide insight into the initial signaling events triggered by Wnt exposure. We emphasize regulation of the $\beta$-catenin destruction and LRP6 signaling complexes and propose a framework for future work in this area.},

In proliferating cells Wnt signaling peaks in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, but the significance of this "mitotic Wnt signaling" is unclear. Here we introduce Wnt-dependent stabilization of proteins (Wnt/STOP), which is independent of $\beta$-catenin and peaks during mitosis. We show that Wnt/STOP plays a critical role in protecting proteins, including c-MYC, from GSK3-dependent polyubiquitination and degradation. Wnt/STOP signaling increases cellular protein levels and cell size. Wnt/STOP, rather than $\beta$-catenin signaling, is the dominant mode of Wnt signaling in several cancer cell lines, where it is required for cell growth. We propose that Wnt/STOP signaling slows down protein degradation as cells prepare to divide.},

Current methods have relied primarily on the assumption that decedent cells are similar to their parents in terms of gene expression levels. These assumptions do not always hold for in-vivo studies which often include infrequently sampled, un-synchronized and diverse cell populations. Thus, additional information may be needed to determine the correct ordering and branching of progenitor cells and the set of transcription factors (TFs) that are active during advancing stages of organogenesis. To enable such modeling we have developed a method that learns a probabilistic model which integrates expression similarity with regulatory information to reconstruct the dynamic developmental cell trajectories.

Many models of complex biological systems are sloppy, which has prompted considerable debate about the identifiability of parameters and methods of selecting optimal experiments to infer parameter values. We explore how the approximate nature of models affects the prospect for accurate parameter estimates and model predictivity in sloppy models when using optimal experimental design. We find that sloppy models may no longer give a good fit to data generated from “optimal” experiments. In this case, the model has much less predictive power than it did before optimal experimental selection. We use a simple hyper-model of model error to quantify the model’s discrepancy from the physical system and discuss the potential limits of accurate parameter estimation in sloppy systems.},

	abstract = {Metastatic dissemination with subsequent clinical outgrowth leads to the greatest part of morbidity and mortality from most solid tumors. Even more daunting is that many of these metastatic deposits silently lie undetected, recurring years to decades after primary tumor extirpation by surgery or radiation (termed metastatic dormancy). As primary tumors are frequently curable, a critical focus now turns to preventing the lethal emergence from metastatic dormancy. Current carcinoma treatments include adjuvant therapy intended to kill the cryptic metastatic tumor cells. Because such standard therapies mainly kill cycling cells, this approach carries an implicit assumption that metastatic cells are in the mitogenic cycle. Thus, the pivotal question arises as to whether clinically occult micrometastases survive in a state of balanced proliferation and death, or whether these cells undergo at least long periods of quiescence marked by cell-cycle arrest. The treatment implications are thus obvious–if the carcinoma cells are cycling then therapies should target cycling cells, whereas if cells are quiescent then therapies should either maintain dormancy or be toxic to dormant cells. Because this distinction is paramount to rational therapeutic development and administration, we investigated whether quiescence or balanced proliferation is the most likely etiology underlying metastatic dormancy. We recently published a computer simulation study that determined that balanced proliferation is not the likely driving force and that quiescence most likely participates in metastatic dormancy. As such, a greater emphasis on developing diagnostics and therapeutics for quiescent carcinomas is needed.},

We identified an additional level of genome organization that is characterized by the spatial segregation of open and closed chromatin to form two genome-wide compartments. At the megabase scale, the chromatin conformation is consistent with a fractal globule, a knot-free, polymer conformation that enables maximally dense packing while preserving the ability to easily fold and unfold any genomic locus. The fractal globule is distinct from the more commonly used globular equilibrium model. Our results demonstrate the power of Hi-C to map the dynamic conformations of whole genomes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:KRAS is the most frequently mutated gene in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), but the mechanisms underlying the transcriptional response to oncogenic KRAS are still not fully understood. We aimed to uncover transcription factors that regulate the transcriptional response of oncogenic KRAS in pancreatic cancer and to understand their clinical relevance. METHODS AND FINDINGS:We applied a well-established network biology approach (master regulator analysis) to combine a transcriptional signature for oncogenic KRAS derived from a murine isogenic cell line with a coexpression network derived by integrating 560 human pancreatic cancer cases across seven studies. The datasets included the ICGC cohort (n = 242), the TCGA cohort (n = 178), and five smaller studies (n = 17, 25, 26, 36, and 36). 55 transcription factors were coexpressed with a significant number of genes in the transcriptional signature (gene set enrichment analysis [GSEA] p {\textless} 0.01). Community detection in the coexpression network identified 27 of the 55 transcription factors contributing to three major biological processes: Notch pathway, down-regulated Hedgehog/Wnt pathway, and cell cycle. The activities of these processes define three distinct subtypes of PDAC, which demonstrate differences in survival and mutational load as well as stromal and immune cell composition. The Hedgehog subgroup showed worst survival (hazard ratio 1.73, 95\% CI 1.1 to 2.72, coxPH test p = 0.018) and the Notch subgroup the best (hazard ratio 0.62, 95\% CI 0.42 to 0.93, coxPH test p = 0.019). The cell cycle subtype showed highest mutational burden (ANOVA p {\textless} 0.01) and the smallest amount of stromal admixture (ANOVA p {\textless} 2.2e-16). This study is limited by the information provided in published datasets, not all of which provide mutational profiles, survival data, or the specifics of treatment history. CONCLUSIONS:Our results characterize the regulatory mechanisms underlying the transcriptional response to oncogenic KRAS and provide a framework to develop strategies for specific subtypes of this disease using current therapeutics and by identifying targets for new groups.},

	abstract = {In developing and self-renewing tissues, terminally differentiated (TD) cell types are typically specified through the actions of multistage cell lineages. Such lineages commonly include a stem cell and multiple progenitor (transit-amplifying) cell stages, which ultimately give rise to TD cells. As the tissue reaches a tightly controlled steady-state size, cells at different lineage stages assume distinct spatial locations within the tissue. Although tissue stratification appears to be genetically specified, the underlying mechanisms that direct tissue lamination are not yet completely understood. Herein, we use modeling and simulations to explore several potential mechanisms that can be utilized to create stratification during developmental or regenerative growth in general systems and in the model system, the olfactory epithelium of mouse. Our results show that tissue stratification can be generated and maintained through controlling spatial distribution of diffusive signaling molecules that regulate the proliferation of each cell type within the lineage. The ability of feedback molecules to stratify a tissue is dependent on a low TD death rate: high death rates decrease tissue lamination. Regulation of the cell cycle lengths of stem cells by feedback signals can lead to transient accumulation of stem cells near the base and apex of tissue.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have shown that nuclear levels of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) are dynamically regulated and may affect access of GSK-3 to its substrates. In this study we show that the GSK-3-binding protein Frat/GBP regulates the nuclear export of GSK-3. We show that Frat/GBP contains a nuclear export sequence that promotes its own nuclear export and that of associated GSK-3. Treating cells with leptomycin B increased nuclear levels of endogenous GSK-3 suggesting that an endogenous process targets GSK-3 for nuclear export. To investigate this further, we used two approaches to disrupt the interaction between GSK-3 and endogenous Frat. First we isolated mutants of GSK-3 that selectively interfered with Frat binding and found that these mutants were poorly exported. Second we expressed a peptide that competes with Frat for GSK-3 binding and found that it caused endogenous GSK-3 to accumulate in the nucleus. Together these data suggest that Frat may be the endogenous factor that targets GSK-3 for nuclear export. The dynamic expression patterns of Frat mRNAs together with the role of Frat in mediating GSK-3 nuclear export have important implications for the control of the substrate access of GSK-3 in several signaling pathways.},

We engineered a genetic module subject to regulation by the lac repressor (LacI) in E. coli, whose expression is beneficial in one environmental condition and detrimental in another. Measured tradeoffs in fitness between environments predict the competition between regulatory phenotypes. We show that regulatory evolution in adverse environments is delayed at specific boundaries in the phenotype space of the regulatory LacI protein. Once this constraint is relieved by mutation, adaptation proceeds toward the optimum, yielding LacI with an altered allosteric mechanism that enables an opposite response to its regulatory ligand IPTG. Our results indicate that regulatory evolution can be understood in terms of tradeoff optimization theory.},

Here we report new methods that permit their clonal analyses and engraftment and demonstrate the two defining features of stem cells, namely self-renewal and multipotency. We also show that, within the bulge, there are two distinct populations, one of which maintains basal lamina contact and temporally precedes the other, which is suprabasal and arises only after the start of the first postnatal hair cycle. This spatial distinction endows them with discrete transcriptional programs, but surprisingly, both populations are growth inhibited in the niche but can self-renew in vitro and make epidermis and hair when grafted. These findings suggest that the niche microenvironment imposes intrinsic "stemness" features without restricting the establishment of epithelial polarity and changes in gene expression.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Models describing the process of stem-cell differentiation are plentiful, and may offer insights into the underlying mechanisms and experimentally observed behaviour. Waddington9s epigenetic landscape has been providing a conceptual framework for differentiation processes since its inception. It also allows, however, for detailed mathematical and quantitative analyses, as the landscape can, at least in principle, be related to mathematical models of dynamical systems. Here we focus on a set of dynamical systems features that are intimately linked to cell differentiation, by considering exemplar dynamical models that capture important aspects of stem cell differentiation dynamics. These models allow us to map the paths that cells take through gene expression space as they move from one fate to another, e.g. from a stem-cell to a more specialized cell type. Our analysis highlights the role of the transition state (TS) that separates distinct cell fates, and how the nature of the TS changes as the underlying landscape changes - change that can be induced by e.g. cellular signalling. We demonstrate that models for stem cell differentiation may be interpreted in terms of either a static or transitory landscape. For the static case the TS represents a particular transcriptional profile that all cells approach during differentiation. Alternatively, the TS may refer to the commonly observed period of heterogeneity as cells undergo stochastic transitions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Biological systems are inherently variable, with their dynamics influenced by intrinsic and extrinsic sources. These systems are often only partially characterized, with large uncertainties about specific sources of extrinsic variability and biochemical properties. Moreover, it is not yet well understood how different sources of variability combine and affect biological systems in concert. To successfully design biomedical therapies or synthetic circuits with robust performance, it is crucial to account for uncertainty and effects of variability. Here we introduce an efficient modeling and simulation framework to study systems that are simultaneously subject to multiple sources of variability, and apply it to make design decisions on small genetic networks that play a role of basic design elements of synthetic circuits. Specifically, the framework was used to explore the effect of transcriptional and post-transcriptional autoregulation on fluctuations in protein expression in simple genetic networks. We found that autoregulation could either suppress or increase the output variability, depending on specific noise sources and network parameters. We showed that transcriptional autoregulation was more successful than post-transcriptional in suppressing variability across a wide range of intrinsic and extrinsic magnitudes and sources. We derived the following design principles to guide the design of circuits that best suppress variability: (i) high protein cooperativity and low miRNA cooperativity, (ii) imperfect complementarity between miRNA and mRNA was preferred to perfect complementarity, and (iii) correlated expression of mRNA and miRNA - for example, on the same transcript - was best for suppression of protein variability. Results further showed that correlations in kinetic parameters between cells affected the ability to suppress variability, and that variability in transient states did not necessarily follow the same principles as variability in the steady state. Our model and findings provide a general framework to guide design principles in synthetic biology.},

This functional subset of cancer cells is operationally defined as the "cancer stem cell" (CSC) subset. Here we developed a CSC model for the study of human colorectal cancer (CRC). Solid CRC tissues, either primary tissues collected from surgical specimens or xenografts established in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice, were disaggregated into single-cell suspensions and analyzed by flow cytometry. Surface markers that displayed intratumor heterogeneous expression among epithelial cancer cells were selected for cell sorting and tumorigenicity experiments. Individual phenotypic cancer cell subsets were purified, and their tumor-initiating properties were investigated by injection in NOD/SCID mice. Our observations indicate that, in six of six human CRC tested, the ability to engraft in vivo in immunodeficient mice was restricted to a minority subpopulation of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM)(high)/CD44+ epithelial cells. Tumors originated from EpCAM(high)/CD44+ cells maintained a differentiated phenotype and reproduced the full morphologic and phenotypic heterogeneity of their parental lesions. Analysis of the surface molecule repertoire of EpCAM(high)/CD44+ cells led to the identification of CD166 as an additional differentially expressed marker, useful for CSC isolation in three of three CRC tested. These results validate the stem cell working model in human CRC and provide a highly robust surface marker profile for CRC stem cell isolation.},

In the last few years, the development of genetic and pharmacological tools has allowed a more precise definition of the specific roles of Rho GTPases in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and progeny of these cells. Rho GTPases are now known to be crucial in HSCs response to hematopoietic microenvironment cues. This article will review the known HSC functions, which are regulated by Rho GTPases. RECENT FINDINGS:This review analyzes the latest data on how different Rho GTPases control adhesion, migration, retention, proliferation, survival, senescence and oncogenic transformation of HSCs and relates these new findings to the physiological functions of these cells. SUMMARY:The development of small molecule inhibitors with ability to interfere Rho GTPase activation by guanine nucleotide exchange factors offers new therapeutic strategies to manipulate the function of HSCs.},

	abstract = {The blood system is sustained by a pool of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that are long-lived due to their capacity for self-renewal. A consequence of longevity is exposure to stress stimuli including reactive oxygen species (ROS), nutrient fluctuation and DNA damage. Damage that occurs within stressed HSCs must be tightly controlled to prevent either loss of function or the clonal persistence of oncogenic mutations that increase the risk of leukaemogenesis. Despite the importance of maintaining cell integrity throughout life, how the HSC pool achieves this and how individual HSCs respond to stress remain poorly understood. Many sources of stress cause misfolded protein accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and subsequent activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) enables the cell to either resolve stress or initiate apoptosis. Here we show that human HSCs are predisposed to apoptosis through strong activation of the PERK branch of the UPR after ER stress, whereas closely related progenitors exhibit an adaptive response leading to their survival. Enhanced ER protein folding by overexpression of the co-chaperone ERDJ4 (also called DNAJB9) increases HSC repopulation capacity in xenograft assays, linking the UPR to HSC function. Because the UPR is a focal point where different sources of stress converge, our study provides a framework for understanding how stress signalling is coordinated within tissue hierarchies and integrated with stemness. Broadly, these findings reveal that the HSC pool maintains clonal integrity by clearance of individual HSCs after stress to prevent propagation of damaged stem cells.},

	abstract = {In large part, cancer results from the accumulation of multiple mutations in a single cell lineage that are sequentially acquired and subject to an evolutionary process where selection drives the expansion of more fit subclones. Owing to the technical challenge of distinguishing and isolating distinct cancer subclones, many aspects of this clonal evolution are poorly understood, including the diversity of different subclones in an individual cancer, the nature of the subclones contributing to relapse, and the identity of pre-cancerous mutations. These issues are not just important to our understanding of cancer biology, but are also clinically important given the need to understand the nature of subclones responsible for the refractory and relapsed disease that cause significant morbidity and mortality in patients. Recently, advanced genomic techniques have been used to investigate clonal diversity and evolution in acute leukemia. Studies of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) demonstrated that in individual patients there are multiple genetic subclones of leukemia-initiating cells, with a complex clonal architecture. Separate studies also investigating pediatric ALL determined that the clonal basis of relapse was variable and complex, with relapse often evolving from a clone ancestral to the predominant de novo leukemia clone. Additional studies in both ALL and acute myeloid leukemia have identified pre-leukemic mutations in some individual cases. This review will highlight these recent reports investigating the clonal evolution of acute leukemia genomes and discuss the implications for clinical therapy.Oncogene advance online publication, 20 February 2012; doi:10.1038/onc.2012.48.},

This putative leukaemic stem cell has not been characterized because the available in vitro assays can only detect progenitors with limited proliferative and replating potential. We have now identified an AML-initiating cell by transplantation into severe combined immune-deficient (SCID) mice. These cells homed to the bone marrow and proliferated extensively in response to in vivo cytokine treatment, resulting in a pattern of dissemination and leukaemic cell morphology similar to that seen in the original patients. Limiting dilution analysis showed that the frequency of these leukaemia-initiating cells in the peripheral blood of AML patients was one engraftment unit in 250,000 cells. We fractionated AML cells on the basis of cell-surface-marker expression and found that the leukaemia-initiating cells that could engraft SCID mice to produce large numbers of colony-forming progenitors were CD34+ CD38-; however, the CD34+ CD38+ and CD34- fractions contained no cells with these properties. This in vivo model replicates many aspects of human AML and defines a new leukaemia-initiating cell which is less mature than colony-forming cells.},

Rather than the traditional null hypothesis testing approach, they have adopted an approach called model selection, in which several competing hypotheses are simultaneously confronted with data. Model selection can be used to identify a single best model, thus lending support to one particular hypothesis, or it can be used to make inferences based on weighted support from a complete set of competing models. Model selection is widely accepted and well developed in certain fields, most notably in molecular systematics and mark-recapture analysis. However, it is now gaining support in several other areas, from molecular evolution to landscape ecology. Here, we outline the steps of model selection and highlight several ways that it is now being implemented. By adopting this approach, researchers in ecology and evolution will find a valuable alternative to traditional null hypothesis testing, especially when more than one hypothesis is plausible.},

	abstract = {The mammalian skin epidermis is a stratified epithelium composed of multiple layers of epithelial cells that exist in appropriate sizes and proportions, and with distinct boundaries separating each other. How the epidermis develops from a single layer of committed precursor cells to form a complex multilayered structure of multiple cell types remains elusive. Here, we construct stochastic, three-dimensional, and multiscale models consisting of a lineage of multiple cell types to study the control of epidermal development. Symmetric and asymmetric cell divisions, stochastic cell fate transitions within the lineage, extracellular morphogens, cell-to-cell adhesion forces, and cell signaling are included in model. A GPU algorithm was developed and implemented to accelerate the simulations. These simulations show that a balance between cell proliferation and differentiation during lineage progression is crucial for the development and maintenance of the epidermal tissue. We also find that selective intercellular adhesion is critical to sharpening the boundary between layers and to the formation of a highly ordered structure. The long-range action of a morphogen provides additional feedback regulations, enhancing the robustness of overall layer formation. Our model is built upon previous experimental findings revealing the role of Ovol transcription factors in regulating epidermal development. Direct comparisons of experimental and simulation perturbations show remarkable consistency. Taken together, our results highlight the major determinants of a well-stratified epidermis: balanced proliferation and differentiation, and a combination of both short- (symmetric/asymmetric division and selective cell adhesion) and long-range (morphogen) regulations. These underlying principles have broad implications for other developmental or regenerative processes leading to the formation of multilayered tissue structures, as well as for pathological processes such as epidermal wound healing.},

However, miRNAs only slightly reduce the mean expression of most targeted proteins, leading to speculation about their role in the variability, or noise, of protein expression. We used mathematical modeling and single-cell reporter assays to show that miRNAs, in conjunction with increased transcription, decrease protein expression noise for lowly expressed genes but increase noise for highly expressed genes. Genes that are regulated by multiple miRNAs show more-pronounced noise reduction. We estimate that hundreds of (lowly expressed) genes in mouse embryonic stem cells have reduced noise due to substantial miRNA regulation. Our findings suggest that miRNAs confer precision to protein expression and thus offer plausible explanations for the commonly observed combinatorial targeting of endogenous genes by multiple miRNAs, as well as the preferential targeting of lowly expressed genes.},

YAP and TAZ activity is key for the growth of whole organs, for amplification of tissue-specific progenitor cells during tissue renewal and regeneration, and for cell proliferation. In tumors, YAP/TAZ can reprogram cancer cells into cancer stem cells and incite tumor initiation, progression and metastasis. As such, YAP/TAZ are appealing therapeutic targets in cancer and regenerative medicine. Just like the function of YAP/TAZ offers a molecular entry point into the mysteries of tissue biology, their regulation by upstream cues is equally captivating. YAP/TAZ are well known for being the effectors of the Hippo signaling cascade, and mouse mutants in Hippo pathway components display remarkable phenotypes of organ overgrowth, enhanced stem cell content and reduced cellular differentiation. YAP/TAZ are primary sensors of the cell's physical nature, as defined by cell structure, shape and polarity. YAP/TAZ activation also reflects the cell “social” behavior, including cell adhesion and the mechanical signals that the cell receives from tissue architecture and surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). At the same time, YAP/TAZ entertain relationships with morphogenetic signals, such as Wnt growth factors, and are also regulated by Rho, GPCRs and mevalonate metabolism. YAP/TAZ thus appear at the centerpiece of a signaling nexus by which cells take control of their behavior according to their own shape, spatial location and growth factor context.},

	abstract = {Interpreting the complex interplay of metabolites in heterogeneous biosamples still poses a challenging task. In this study, we propose independent component analysis (ICA) as a multivariate analysis tool for the interpretation of large-scale metabolomics data. In particular, we employ a Bayesian ICA method based on a mean-field approach, which allows us to statistically infer the number of independent components to be reconstructed. The advantage of ICA over correlation-based methods like principal component analysis (PCA) is the utilization of higher order statistical dependencies, which not only yield additional information but also allow a more meaningful representation of the data with fewer components. We performed the described ICA approach on a large-scale metabolomics data set of human serum samples, comprising a total of 1764 study probands with 218 measured metabolites. Inspecting the source matrix of statistically independent metabolite profiles using a weighted enrichment algorithm, we observe strong enrichment of specific metabolic pathways in all components. This includes signatures from amino acid metabolism, energy-related processes, carbohydrate metabolism, and lipid metabolism. Our results imply that the human blood metabolome is composed of a distinct set of overlaying, statistically independent signals. ICA furthermore produces a mixing matrix, describing the strength of each independent component for each of the study probands. Correlating these values with plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, we establish a novel association between HDL plasma levels and the branched-chain amino acid pathway. We conclude that the Bayesian ICA methodology has the power and flexibility to replace many of the nowadays common PCA and clustering-based analyses common in the research field.},

By electron microscopy of single PHO5 gene molecules from yeast, we show that the "activated" promoter assumes alternative nucleosome configurations at steady state, including the maximally repressive, fully nucleosomal, and the maximally non-repressive, nucleosome-free, configuration. We demonstrate that the observed probabilities of promoter nucleosome configurations are obtained from a simple, intrinsically stochastic process of nucleosome assembly, disassembly, and position-specific sliding; and we show that gene expression and promoter nucleosome configuration can be mechanistically coupled, relating promoter nucleosome dynamics and gene expression fluctuations. Together, our findings suggest a structural basis for transcriptional bursting, and offer new insights into the mechanism of transcriptional regulation and the kinetics of promoter nucleosome transitions.},

Recent studies have examined the role that adipocytes play in the biology of the HSCs in different bone locations and in transplantation settings; however, none have examined their role under homeostatic conditions. We compared the ability of adipocytic and nonadipocytic cell lines to support primitive hematopoietic cells in vitro. Preadipocytic cell lines demonstrated enhanced support of hematopoietic cells. Similarly, primary bone marrow (BM) cells treated with troglitazone, a drug that enhances adipogenesis, also demonstrated augmented support over control-treated stromal cells. We further examined the effects of increased adipocyte number in vivo under homeostatic conditions using troglitazone treatment and found that these alterations had no effect on HSC frequency. Taken together, we demonstrate that cells of the adipocyte lineage promote the ability of stromal cells to support primitive hematopoietic cells in vitro, yet alterations of adipocyte number and volume in vivo have no effect. These data suggest that adipocytes are not a component of the adult BM HSC niche under homeostatic conditions.},

Unique to vertebrate embryos, it has served as an excellent model system for the study of cell behavior and identity owing to its multipotency, motility and ability to form a broad array of cell types. Neural crest development is thought to be controlled by a suite of transcriptional and epigenetic inputs arranged hierarchically in a gene regulatory network. Here, we examine neural crest development from a gene regulatory perspective and discuss how the underlying genetic circuitry results in the features that define this unique cell population.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are generated via a natural transdifferentiation process known as endothelial to hematopoietic cell transition (EHT). Because of small numbers of embryonal arterial cells undergoing EHT and the paucity of markers to enrich for hemogenic endothelial cells (ECs [HECs]), the genetic program driving HSC emergence is largely unknown. Here, we use a highly sensitive RNAseq method to examine the whole transcriptome of small numbers of enriched aortic HSCs, HECs, and ECs. Gpr56, a G-coupled protein receptor, is one of the most highly up-regulated of the 530 differentially expressed genes. Also, highly up-regulated are hematopoietic transcription factors, including the “heptad” complex of factors. We show that \textit{Gpr56} (mouse and human) is a target of the heptad complex and is required for hematopoietic cluster formation during EHT. Our results identify the processes and regulators involved in EHT and reveal the surprising requirement for Gpr56 in generating the first HSCs.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Oct4 and Sox2 are transcription factors required for pluripotency during early embryogenesis and for the maintenance of embryonic stem cell (ESC) identity. Functional mechanisms contributing to pluripotency are expected to be associated with genes transcriptionally activated by these factors. Here, we show that Oct4 and Sox2 bind to a conserved promoter region of miR-302, a cluster of eight microRNAs expressed specifically in ESCs and pluripotent cells. The expression of miR-302a is dependent on Oct4/Sox2 in human ESCs (hESCs), and miR-302a is expressed at the same developmental stages and in the same tissues as Oct4 during embryogenesis. miR-302a is predicted to target many cell cycle regulators, and the expression of miR-302a in primary and transformed cell lines promotes an increase in S-phase and a decrease in G(1)-phase cells, reminiscent of an ESC-like cell cycle profile. Correspondingly, the inhibition of miR-302 causes hESCs to accumulate in G(1) phase. Moreover, we show that miR-302a represses the productive translation of an important G(1) regulator, cyclin D1, in hESCs. The transcriptional activation of miR-302 and the translational repression of its targets, such as cyclin D1, may provide a link between Oct4/Sox2 and cell cycle regulation in pluripotent cells.},

	abstract = {Over the years, agent-based models have been developed that combine cell division and reinforced random walks of cells on a regular lattice, reaction-diffusion equations for nutrients and growth factors; and ordinary differential equations for the subcellular networks regulating the cell cycle. When linked to a vascular layer, this multiple scale model framework has been applied to tumour growth and therapy. Here, we report on the creation of an agent-based multi-scale environment amalgamating the characteristics of these models within a Virtual Physiological Human (VPH) Exemplar Project. This project enables reuse, integration, expansion and sharing of the model and relevant data. The agent-based and reaction-diffusion parts of the multi-scale model have been implemented and are available for download as part of the latest public release of Chaste (Cancer, Heart and Soft Tissue Environment; http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste/), part of the VPH Toolkit (http://toolkit.vph-noe.eu/). The environment functionalities are verified against the original models, in addition to extra validation of all aspects of the code. In this work, we present the details of the implementation of the agent-based environment, including the system description, the conceptual model, the development of the simulation model and the processes of verification and validation of the simulation results. We explore the potential use of the environment by presenting exemplar applications of the 'what if' scenarios that can easily be studied in the environment. These examples relate to tumour growth, cellular competition for resources and tumour responses to hypoxia (low oxygen levels). We conclude our work by summarizing the future steps for the expansion of the current system.},

	abstract = {For nearly any challenging scientific problem evaluation of the likelihood is problematic if not impossible. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) allows us to employ the whole Bayesian formalism to problems where we can use simulations from a model, but cannot evaluate the likelihood directly. When summary statistics of real and simulated data are compared – rather than the data directly – information is lost, unless the summary statistics are sufficient. Here we employ an information-theoretical framework that can be used to construct (approximately) sufficient statistics by combining different statistics until the loss of information is minimized. Such sufficient sets of statistics are constructed for both parameter estimation and model selection problems. We apply our approach to a range of illustrative and real-world model selection problems.},

	abstract = {The extensive development of detailed mathematical models of cardiac myocyte electrophysiology in recent years has led to a proliferation of models, including many that model the same animal species and specific region of the heart and thus would be expected to have similar properties. In this paper we review and compare two recently developed mathematical models of the electrophysiology of canine ventricular myocytes. To clarify their similarities and differences, we also present studies using them in a range of preparations from single cells to two-dimensional tissue. The models are compared with each other and with new and previously published experimental results in terms of a number of their properties, including action potential morphologies; transmembrane currents during normal heart rates and during alternans; alternans onsets, magnitudes, and cessations; and reentry dynamics of spiral waves. Action potential applets and spiral wave movies for the two canine ventricular models are available online as supplemental material. We find a number of differences between the models, including their rate dependence, alternans dynamics, and reentry stability, and a number of differences compared with experiments. Differences between models of the same species and region of the heart are not unique to these canine models. Similar differences can be found in the behavior of two models of human ventricular myocytes and of human atrial myocytes. We provide several possible explanations for the differences observed in models of the same species and region of the heart and discuss the implications for the applicability of models in addressing questions of mechanism in cardiac electrophysiology.},

We show that reporter expression is nearly ubiquitous, allowing visualization of fluorescent markers in live and fixed samples of all tissues examined. We further demonstrate that mG labeling is Cre-dependent, complementary to mT at single cell resolution, and distinguishable by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Both membrane-targeted markers outline cell morphology, highlight membrane structures, and permit visualization of fine cellular processes. In addition to serving as a global Cre reporter, the mT/mG mouse may also be used as a tool for lineage tracing, transplantation studies, and analysis of cell morphology in vivo.},

Integrative clustering further emphasized the dominant role of cell-of-origin patterns. Molecular similarities among histologically or anatomically related cancer types provide a basis for focused pan-cancer analyses, such as pan-gastrointestinal, pan-gynecological, pan-kidney, and pan-squamous cancers, and those related by stemness features, which in turn may inform strategies for future therapeutic development.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Bone metastasis will impact most men with advanced prostate cancer. The vicious cycle of bone degradation and formation driven by metastatic prostate cells in bone yields factors that drive cancer growth. Mechanistic insights into this vicious cycle have suggested new therapeutic opportunities, but complex temporal and cellular interactions in the bone microenvironment make drug development challenging. We have integrated biologic and computational approaches to generate a hybrid cellular automata model of normal bone matrix homeostasis and the prostate cancer-bone microenvironment. The model accurately reproduces the basic multicellular unit bone coupling process, such that introduction of a single prostate cancer cell yields a vicious cycle similar in cellular composition and pathophysiology to models of prostate-to-bone metastasis. Notably, the model revealed distinct phases of osteolytic and osteogenic activity, a critical role for mesenchymal stromal cells in osteogenesis, and temporal changes in cellular composition. To evaluate the robustness of the model, we assessed the effect of established bisphosphonate and anti-RANKL therapies on bone metastases. At approximately 100\% efficacy, bisphosphonates inhibited cancer progression while, in contrast with clinical observations in humans, anti-RANKL therapy fully eradicated metastases. Reducing anti-RANKL yielded clinically similar results, suggesting that better targeting or dosing could improve patient survival. Our work establishes a computational model that can be tailored for rapid assessment of experimental therapies and delivery of precision medicine to patients with prostate cancer with bone metastases.

	abstract = {Females are natural mosaics for X chromosome-linked genes. As X chromosome inactivation occurs randomly, the ratio of parental phenotypes among blood cells is approximately 1:1. Recently, however, ratios of greater than 3:1 have been observed in 38-56\% of women over age 60. This could result from a depletion of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with aging (and the maintenance of hematopoiesis by a few residual clones) or from myelodysplasia (the dominance of a neoplastic clone). Each possibility has major implications for chemotherapy and for transplantation in elderly patients. We report similar findings in longitudinal studies of female Safari cats and demonstrate that the excessive skewing that develops with aging results from a third mechanism that has no pathologic consequence, hemizygous selection. We show that there is a competitive advantage for all HSCs with a specific X chromosome phenotype and, thus, demonstrate that an X chromosome gene (or genes) regulates HSC replication, differentiation, and/or survival.},

All of these genes are detected as early as embryonic day 11.5. Because these genes are known to be induced by proneural genes during neurogenesis, we analyzed the expression of MTG genes in relation to two proneural genes, Neurog2 (also known as Ngn2 or Neurogenin 2) and Ascl1 (also known as Mash1). While MTGR1 are generally expressed in regions that also express Neurog2, MTG8 and MTG16 expression is associated more tightly with that of Ascl1-expressing neural progenitor cells. These results suggest the possibility that expression of MTG genes is differentially controlled by specific proneural genes during neurogenesis.},

But as models of reality, they are only useful if we have realistic parameters for the molecular reaction rates and cell physiological processes. There is currently no suitable framework to reliably estimate hundreds, let alone thousands, of reaction rate parameters. Here, we map out the relative weaknesses and promises of different approaches aimed at redressing this issue. While suitable procedures for estimation or inference of the whole (vast) set of parameters will, in all likelihood, remain elusive, some hope can be drawn from the fact that much of the cellular behaviour may be explained in terms of smaller sets of parameters. Identifying such parameter sets and assessing their behaviour is now becoming possible even for very large systems of equations, and we expect such methods to become central tools in the development and analysis of whole-cell models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Assuming that an ensemble of the final nodal states resulting from statistically independent initial triggers (signals) of the spreading dynamics is available, we develop a maximum likelihood estimation{\textbackslash}char21based framework to accurately infer the interaction topology. For dynamical processes that result in a binary final state, the framework enables network reconstruction based solely on the final nodal states. Additional information, such as the first arrival time of each signal at each node, can improve the reconstruction accuracy. For processes with a uniform final state, the first arrival times can be exploited to reconstruct the network. We derive a mathematical theory for our framework and validate its performance and robustness using various combinations of spreading dynamics and real-world network topologies.},

Robust inference of cell state transition paths and probabilities is an important yet challenging step in the analysis of these data. Results:Here we present scEpath, an algorithm that calculates energy landscapes and probabilistic directed graphs in order to reconstruct developmental trajectories. We quantify the energy landscape using "single-cell energy" and distance-based measures, and find that the combination of these enables robust inference of the transition probabilities and lineage relationships between cell states. We also identify marker genes and gene expression patterns associated with cell state transitions. Our approach produces pseudotemporal orderings that are - in combination - more robust and accurate than current methods, and offers higher resolution dynamics of the cell state transitions, leading to new insight into key transition events during differentiation and development. Moreover, scEpath is robust to variation in the size of the input gene set, and is broadly unsupervised, requiring few parameters to be set by the user. Applications of scEpath led to the identification of a cell-cell communication network implicated in early human embryo development, and novel transcription factors important for myoblast differentiation. scEpath allows us to identify common and specific temporal dynamics and transcriptional factor programs along branched lineages, as well as the transition probabilities that control cell fates.

	abstract = {Considerable progress has been made in applying Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to the analy- sis of epidemic data. However, this likelihood based method can be inefficient due to the limited data available concern- ing an epidemic outbreak. This paper considers an alter- native approach to studying epidemic data using Approxi- mate Bayesian Computation (ABC) methodology. ABC is a simulation-based technique for obtaining an approximate sample from the posterior distribution of the parameters of the model and in an epidemic context is very easy to imple- ment. A new approach to ABC is introduced which gener- ates a set of values from the (approximate) posterior dis- tribution of the parameters during each simulation rather than a single value. This is based upon coupling simula- tions with different sets of parameters and we call the re- sulting algorithm coupled ABC. The new methodology is used to analyse final size data for epidemics amongst com- munities partitioned into households. It is shown that for the epidemic data sets coupled ABC is more efficient than ABC and MCMC-ABC.},

The application of population dynamics to biology is amongst the oldest applications of mathematics to biology, and the population dynamics perspective continues to offer much today. Here we describe the impact that such a perspective has made in the field of stem cell biology. Using hematopoietic stem cells as our model system, we discuss the approaches that have been used to study their key properties, such as capacity for self-renewal, differentiation, and cell fate lineage choice. We will also discuss the relevance of population dynamics in models of stem cells and cancer, where competition naturally emerges as an influential factor on the temporal evolution of cell populations.

	doi = {10.1101/096032},
	abstract = {The adult mammalian kidney has a complex, highly-branched collecting duct epithelium that arises as a ureteric bud sidebranch from an epithelial tube known as the nephric duct. Subsequent branching of the ureteric bud to form the collecting duct tree is regulated by subcellular interactions between the epithelium and a population of mesenchymal cells that surround the tips of outgrowing branches. The mesenchymal cells produce glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), that binds with RET receptors on the surface of the epithelial cells to stimulate several subcellular pathways in the epithelium. Such interactions are known to be a prerequisite for normal branching development, although competing theories exist for their role in morphogenesis. Here we introduce the first agent-based model of ex vivo kidney uretic branching. Through comparison with experimental data, we show that growth factor-regulated growth mechanisms can explain early epithelial cell branching, but only if epithelial cell division depends in a switch-like way on the local growth factor concentration; cell division occurring only if the driving growth factor level exceeds a threshold. We also show how a recently-developed method, “Approximate Approximate Bayesian Computation”, can be used to infer key model parameters, and reveal the dependency between the parameters controlling a growth factor-dependent growth switch. These results are consistent with a requirement for signals controlling proliferation and chemotaxis, both of which are previously identified roles for GDNF.},

	abstract = {The mammalian lung is a highly branched network in which the distal regions of the bronchial tree transform during development into a densely packed honeycomb of alveolar air sacs that mediate gas exchange. Although this transformation has been studied by marker expression analysis and fate-mapping, the mechanisms that control the progression of lung progenitors along distinct lineages into mature alveolar cell types are still incompletely known, in part because of the limited number of lineage markers and the effects of ensemble averaging in conventional transcriptome analysis experiments on cell populations. Here we show that single-cell transcriptome analysis circumvents these problems and enables direct measurement of the various cell types and hierarchies in the developing lung. We used microfluidic single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on 198 individual cells at four different stages encompassing alveolar differentiation to measure the transcriptional states which define the developmental and cellular hierarchy of the distal mouse lung epithelium. We empirically classified cells into distinct groups by using an unbiased genome-wide approach that did not require a priori knowledge of the underlying cell types or the previous purification of cell populations. The results confirmed the basic outlines of the classical model of epithelial cell-type diversity in the distal lung and led to the discovery of many previously unknown cell-type markers, including transcriptional regulators that discriminate between the different populations. We reconstructed the molecular steps during maturation of bipotential progenitors along both alveolar lineages and elucidated the full life cycle of the alveolar type 2 cell lineage. This single-cell genomics approach is applicable to any developing or mature tissue to robustly delineate molecularly distinct cell types, define progenitors and lineage hierarchies, and identify lineage-specific regulatory factors.},

	abstract = {Branching morphogenesis is central to epithelial organogenesis. In the developing kidney, the epithelial ureteric bud invades the metanephric mesenchyme, which directs the ureteric bud to undergo repeated branching. A soluble factor(s) in the conditioned medium of a metanephric mesenchyme cell line is essential for multiple branching morphogenesis of the isolated ureteric bud. The identity of this factor had proved elusive, but it appeared distinct from factors such as HGF and EGF receptor ligands that have been previously implicated in branching morphogenesis of mature epithelial cell lines. Using sequential column chromatography, we have now purified to apparent homogeneity an 18 kDa protein, pleiotrophin, from the conditioned medium of a metanephric mesenchyme cell line that induces isolated ureteric bud branching morphogenesis in the presence of glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor. Pleiotrophin alone was also found to induce the formation of branching tubules in an immortalized ureteric bud cell line cultured three-dimensionally in an extracellular matrix gel. Consistent with an important role in ureteric bud morphogenesis during kidney development, pleiotrophin was found to localize to the basement membrane of the developing ureteric bud in the embryonic kidney. We suggest that pleiotrophin could act as a key mesenchymally derived factor regulating branching morphogenesis of the ureteric bud and perhaps other embryonic epithelial structures.},

Using Bayesian methods we infer parameters for each model from mammalian Wnt signaling data and find that all models can fit this time course. We appeal to algebraic methods (concepts from chemical reaction network theory and matroid theory) to analyze the models without recourse to specific parameter values. These approaches provide insight into aspects of Wnt regulation: the new model, via control of shuttling and degradation parameters, permits multiple stable steady states corresponding to stem-like vs. committed cell states in the differentiation hierarchy. Our analysis also identifies groups of variables that should be measured to fully characterize and discriminate between competing models, and thus serves as a guide for performing minimal experiments for model comparison.},

Imposing additional constraints with strong and biologically motivated regularizations is critical in developing reliable and effective algorithms for inferring gene expression programs. Here we propose a new form of regulation that constrains the number of independent connectivity patterns between regulators and targets, motivated by the modular design of gene regulatory programs and the belief that the total number of independent regulatory modules should be small. We formulate a multi-target linear regression framework to incorporate this type of regulation, in which the number of independent connectivity patterns is expressed as the rank of the connectivity matrix between regulators and targets. We then generalize the linear framework to nonlinear cases, and prove that the generalized low-rank regularization model is still convex. Efficient algorithms are derived to solve both the linear and nonlinear low-rank regularized problems. Finally, we test the algorithms on three gene expression datasets, and show that the low-rank regularization improves the accuracy of gene expression prediction in these three datasets.},

	abstract = {We consider some of the problems involved in current discussions on stem cells in adult mammalian tissues. The present concepts involve a number of pitfalls, weaknesses and logical, semantic and classification problems. This indicates the necessity for new and well-defined concepts that are amenable to experimental analysis. One of the major difficulties in considering stem cells is that they are defined in terms of their functional capabilities which can only be assessed by testing the abilities of the cells, which itself may alter their characteristics during the assay procedure: a situation similar to the uncertainty principle in physics. The terms that describe stem cell functions are often not well defined and are used loosely, which can lead to confusion. If such context-dependent interactions exist between the manipulation and measurement process and the challenged stem cells, the question of, for example, the number of stem cells, in a tissue has to be posed in a new way. Rather than obtaining a single number one might end up with various different numbers under different circumstances, all being complementary. This might suggest that stemness is not a property but a spectrum of capabilities from which to choose. This concept might facilitate a reconciliation between the different and sometimes opposing experimental results. Given certain experimental evidence, we have attempted to provide a novel concept to describe structured cell populations in tissues involving stem cells, transit cells and mature cells. It is based on the primary assumption that the proliferation and differentiation/maturation processes are in principle independent entities in the sense that each may proceed without necessarily affecting the other. Stem cells may divide without maturation while cells approaching functional competence may mature but do not divide. In contrast, transit cells divide and mature showing intermediate properties between stem cells and mature functional cells. The need to describe this transition process and the variable coupling between proliferation and maturation leads us to formulate a spiral model of cell and tissue organisation. This concept is illustrated for the intestinal epithelium. It is concluded that the small intestinal crypts contain 4-16 actual stem cells in steady state but up to 30-40 potential stem cells (clonogenic cells) which may take over stem cell properties following perturbations. This implies that transit cells can under certain circumstances behave like actual stem cells while they undergo maturation under other conditions. There is also evidence that the proliferation and differentiation/maturation processes are subject to controls that ultimately lead to a change in the spiral trajectories.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	abstract = {The incidence of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) increases with age and mortality exceeds 90\% when diagnosed after age 65. Most cases arise without any detectable early symptoms and patients usually present with the acute complications of bone marrow failure1. The onset of such de novo AML cases is typically preceded by the accumulation of somatic mutations in preleukaemic haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) that undergo clonal expansion2,3. However, recurrent AML mutations also accumulate in HSPCs during ageing of healthy individuals who do not develop AML, a phenomenon referred to as age-related clonal haematopoiesis (ARCH)4–8. Here we use deep sequencing to analyse genes that are recurrently mutated in AML to distinguish between individuals who have a high risk of developing AML and those with benign ARCH. We analysed peripheral blood cells from 95 individuals that were obtained on average 6.3 years before AML diagnosis (pre-AML group), together with 414 unselected age- and gender-matched individuals (control group). Pre-AML cases were distinct from controls and had more mutations per sample, higher variant allele frequencies, indicating greater clonal expansion, and showed enrichment of mutations in specific genes. Genetic parameters were used to derive a model that accurately predicted AML-free survival; this model was validated in an independent cohort of 29 pre-AML cases and 262 controls. Because AML is rare, we also developed an AML predictive model using a large electronic health record database that identified individuals at greater risk. Collectively our findings provide proof-of-concept that it is possible to discriminate ARCH from pre-AML many years before malignant transformation. This could in future enable earlier detection and monitoring, and may help to inform intervention.},

	abstract = {The alphabaculovirus Anticarsia gemmatalis multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AgMNPV) is the world's most successful viral bioinsecticide. Through the 1980s and 1990s, this virus was extensively used for biological control of populations of Anticarsia gemmatalis (Velvetbean caterpillar) in soybean crops. During this period, genetic studies identified several variable loci in the AgMNPV; however, most of them were not characterized at the sequence level. In this study we report a full genome comparison among 17 wild-type isolates of AgMNPV. We found the pangenome of this virus to contain at least 167 hypothetical genes, 151 of which are shared by all genomes. The gene bro-a that might be involved in host specificity and carrying transporter is absent in some genomes, and new hypothetical genes were observed. Among these genes there is a unique rnf12-like gene, probably implicated in ubiquitination. Events of gene fission and fusion are common, as four genes have been observed as single or split open reading frames. Gains and losses of genomic fragments (from 20 to 900 bp) are observed within tandem repeats, such as in eight direct repeats and four homologous regions. Most AgMNPV genes present low nucleotide diversity, and variable genes are mainly located in a locus known to evolve through homologous recombination. The evolution of AgMNPV is mainly driven by small indels, substitutions, gain and loss of nucleotide stretches or entire coding sequences. These variations may cause relevant phenotypic alterations, which probably affect the infectivity of AgMNPV. This work provides novel information on genomic evolution of the AgMNPV in particular and of baculoviruses in general.},

We now know that EPO is a pleiotropic growth factor that exhibits an anti-apoptotic action on numerous cells and tissues, including malignant ones. In this article, we present a short discussion of EPO, receptors involved in EPO signal transduction, and their action on non-hematopoietic cells. This is followed by a more detailed presentation of both pre-clinical and clinical data that demonstrate EPO’s action on cancer cells as well as tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. Clinical trials with reported adverse effects of erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) as well as clinical studies exploring the prognostic significance of EPO and EPOR expression in cancer patients are reviewed.

	abstract = {When exact values of model parameters in systems biology are not available from experiments, they need to be inferred so that the resulting simulation reproduces the experimentally known phenomena. For the purpose, Bayesian statistics with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a useful method. Biological experiments are often performed with cell population, and the results are represented by histograms. On another front, experiments sometimes indicate the existence of a specific bifurcation pattern. In this study, to deal with both type of such experimental results and information for parameter inference, we introduced functions to evaluate fitness to both type of experimental results, named quantitative and qualitative fitness measures respectively. We formulated Bayesian formula for those hybrid fitness measures (HFM), and implemented it to MCMC (MCMC-HFM). We tested MCMC-HFM first for a kinetic toy model with a positive feedback. Inferring kinetic parameters mainly related to the positive feedback, we found that MCMC-HFM reliably infer them with both qualitative and quantitative fitness measures. Then, we applied the MCMC-HFM to an apoptosis signal transduction network previously proposed. For kinetic parameters related to implicit positive feedbacks, which are important for bistability and irreversibility of the output, the MCMC-HFM reliably inferred these kinetic parameters. In particular, some kinetic parameters that have the experimental estimates were inferred without these data and the results were consistent with the experiments. Moreover, for some parameters, the mixed use of quantitative and qualitative fitness measures narrowed down the acceptable range of parameters. Taken together, our approach could reliably infer the kinetic parameters of the target systems.},

The F-box protein Cdc4 captures phosphorylated forms of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Sic1 for ubiquitination in late G1 phase, an event necessary for the onset of DNA replication. The WD40 repeat domain of Cdc4 binds with high affinity to a consensus phosphopeptide motif (the Cdc4 phospho-degron, CPD), yet Sic1 itself has many sub-optimal CPD motifs that act in concert to mediate Cdc4 binding. The weak CPD sites in Sic1 establish a phosphorylation threshold that delays degradation in vivo, and thereby establishes a minimal G1 phase period needed to ensure proper DNA replication. Multisite phosphorylation may be a more general mechanism to set thresholds in regulated protein-protein interactions.},

Here we reveal maps of bodily sensations associated with different emotions using a unique topographical self-report method. In five experiments, participants (n = 701) were shown two silhouettes of bodies alongside emotional words, stories, movies, or facial expressions. They were asked to color the bodily regions whose activity they felt increasing or decreasing while viewing each stimulus. Different emotions were consistently associated with statistically separable bodily sensation maps across experiments. These maps were concordant across West European and East Asian samples. Statistical classifiers distinguished emotion-specific activation maps accurately, confirming independence of topographies across emotions. We propose that emotions are represented in the somatosensory system as culturally universal categorical somatotopic maps. Perception of these emotion-triggered bodily changes may play a key role in generating consciously felt emotions.},

RNA-seq has fueled much discovery and innovation in medicine over recent years. For practical reasons, the technique is usually conducted on samples comprising thousands to millions of cells. However, this has hindered direct assessment of the fundamental unit of biology—the cell. Since the first single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) study was published in 2009, many more have been conducted, mostly by specialist laboratories with unique skills in wet-lab single-cell genomics, bioinformatics, and computation. However, with the increasing commercial availability of scRNA-seq platforms, and the rapid ongoing maturation of bioinformatics approaches, a point has been reached where any biomedical researcher or clinician can use scRNA-seq to make exciting discoveries. In this review, we present a practical guide to help researchers design their first scRNA-seq studies, including introductory information on experimental hardware, protocol choice, quality control, data analysis and biological interpretation.},

Although several BCSC markers have been described, it is unclear whether these markers identify the same or independent BCSCs. Here, we show that BCSCs exist in distinct mesenchymal-like (epithelial-mesenchymal transition [EMT]) and epithelial-like (mesenchymal-epithelial transition [MET]) states. Mesenchymal-like BCSCs characterized as CD24(-)CD44(+) are primarily quiescent and localized at the tumor invasive front, whereas epithelial-like BCSCs express aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), are proliferative, and are located more centrally. The gene-expression profiles of mesenchymal-like and epithelial-like BCSCs are remarkably similar across different molecular subtypes of breast cancer, and resemble those of distinct basal and luminal stem cells found in the normal breast. We propose that the plasticity of BCSCs that allows them to transition between EMT- and MET-like states endows these cells with the capacity for tissue invasion, dissemination, and growth at metastatic sites.},

Combined with unsupervised classification algorithms, this facilitates ab initio cell-type characterization of splenic tissues. Modeling single-cell transcriptional states in dendritic cells and additional hematopoietic cell types uncovers rich cell-type heterogeneity and gene-modules activity in steady state and after pathogen activation. Cellular diversity is thereby approached through inference of variable and dynamic pathway activity rather than a fixed preprogrammed cell-type hierarchy. These data demonstrate single-cell RNA-seq as an effective tool for comprehensive cellular decomposition of complex tissues.},

These two models are difficult to distinguish experimentally, yet the differences between them is of great importance to both our understanding of the metastatic process and also for designing methods of intervention. Therefore, we developed a mathematical model to test the relative likelihood of these two phenomena in the subset of tumours whose shed CTCs first encounter the lung capillary bed, and show that secondary seeding is several orders of magnitude more likely than primary seeding. We suggest how this difference could affect tumour evolution, progression and therapy, and propose several possible methods of experimental validation.},

Using a syngeneic retroviral model of MLL-AF9 induced acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we have identified 2 different stages of leukemia progression, propagated by "pre-LSCs" and established leukemia (LSCs) and compared the homing properties of these distinctive entities to that of normal HSCs. The homing and microlocalization of pre-LSCs was most similar to long-term HSCs and was dependent on cell-intrinsic Wnt signaling. In contrast, the homing of established LSCs was most similar to that of committed myeloid progenitors and distinct from HSCs. Although osteoblast-derived Dickkopf-1, a potent Wnt inhibitor known to impair HSC function, dramatically impaired normal HSC localization within the bone marrow, it did not affect pre-LSCs, LSC homing, or AML development. Mechanistically, cell-intrinsic Wnt activation was observed in human and murine AML samples, explaining the independence of MLL-AF9 LSCs from niche-derived Wnt signals. These data identify differential engagement of HM associated with leukemic progression and identify an LSC niche that is physically distinct and independent of the constraints of Wnt signaling that apply to normal HSCs.},

	abstract = {Specification of endoderm is the prerequisite for gut formation in the embryogenesis of bilaterian organisms. Modern lineage labelling studies have shown that in the sea urchin embryo model system, descendants of the veg1 and veg2 cell lineages produce the endoderm, and that the veg2 lineage also gives rise to mesodermal cell types. It is known that Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signalling is required for endoderm specification and Delta/Notch signalling is required for mesoderm specification. Some direct cis-regulatory targets of these signals have been found and various phenomenological patterns of gene expression have been observed in the pre-gastrular endomesoderm. However, no comprehensive, causal explanation of endoderm specification has been conceived for sea urchins, nor for any other deuterostome. Here we propose a model, on the basis of the underlying genomic control system, that provides such an explanation, built at several levels of biological organization. The hardwired core of the control system consists of the cis-regulatory apparatus of endodermal regulatory genes, which determine the relationship between the inputs to which these genes are exposed and their outputs. The architecture of the network circuitry controlling the dynamic process of endoderm specification then explains, at the system level, a sequence of developmental logic operations, which generate the biological process. The control system initiates non-interacting endodermal and mesodermal gene regulatory networks in veg2-derived cells and extinguishes the endodermal gene regulatory network in mesodermal precursors. It also generates a cross-regulatory network that specifies future anterior endoderm in veg2 descendants and institutes a distinct network specifying posterior endoderm in veg1-derived cells. The network model provides an explanatory framework that relates endoderm specification to the genomic regulatory code.},

We stimulated intestinal organoids with Notch ligands and inhibitors and discovered that intestinal stem cells employ a positive feedback mechanism via direct Notch binding to the second intron of the Notch1 gene. Inactivation of the positive feedback by CRISPR/Cas9 mutation of the binding sequence alters the mosaic stem cell niche pattern and hinders regeneration in organoids.

Information invariances set the commonly observed measurement scales and the relations between them. In particular, a measurement scale for information is defined by its invariance to specific transformations of underlying values into measurable outputs.

Using an agent-based framework to model spatial competition among sensitive and resistant populations, we applied antiproliferative drug treatments to varying ratios of sensitive and resistant cells. We compared a continuous maximum-tolerated dose schedule with an adaptive schedule aimed at tumor control via competition between sensitive and resistant cells. Continuous treatment cured mostly sensitive tumors, but with any resistant cells, recurrence was inevitable. We identified two adaptive strategies that control heterogeneous tumors: dose modulation controls most tumors with less drug, while a more vacation-oriented schedule can control more invasive tumors. These findings offer potential modifications to treatment regimens that may improve outcomes and reduce resistance and recurrence.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}\textbf{Significance:} By using drug dose modulation or treatment vacations, adaptive therapy strategies control the emergence of tumor drug resistance by spatially suppressing less fit resistant populations in favor of treatment sensitive ones. \textit{Cancer Res; 78(8); 2127–39. ©2018 AACR}.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

These games have been used to model many biologically relevant scenarios, ranging from social dilemmas in mammals to microbial diversity. Some of these games may, in fact, take place between a number of individuals and not just between two. Here we address one-shot games with multiple players. As long as we have only two strategies, many results from two-player games can be generalized to multiple players. For games with multiple players and more than two strategies, we show that statements derived for pairwise interactions no longer hold. For two-player games with any number of strategies there can be at most one isolated internal equilibrium. For any number of players with any number of strategies , there can be at most isolated internal equilibria. Multiplayer games show a great dynamical complexity that cannot be captured based on pairwise interactions. Our results hold for any game and can easily be applied to specific cases, such as public goods games or multiplayer stag hunts.},

	abstract = {Treatment of BRAF -mutant melanomas with MAP kinase pathway inhibitors is paradigmatic of the promise of precision cancer therapy but also highlights problems with drug resistance that limit patient benefit. We use live-cell imaging, single-cell analysis, and molecular profiling to show that exposure of tumor cells to RAF/MEK inhibitors elicits a heterogeneous response in which some cells die, some arrest, and the remainder adapt to drug. Drug-adapted cells up-regulate markers of the neural crest (e.g., NGFR), a melanocyte precursor, and grow slowly. This phenotype is transiently stable, reverting to the drug-naïve state within 9 days of drug withdrawal. Transcriptional profiling of cell lines and human tumors implicates a c-Jun/ECM/FAK/Src cascade in de-differentiation in about one-third of cell lines studied; drug-induced changes in c-Jun and NGFR levels are also observed in xenograft and human tumors. Drugs targeting the c-Jun/ECM/FAK/Src cascade as well as BET bromodomain inhibitors increase the maximum effect ( E max) of RAF/MEK kinase inhibitors by promoting cell killing. Thus, analysis of reversible drug resistance at a single-cell level identifies signaling pathways and inhibitory drugs missed by assays that focus on cell populations. ![][1]{\textless}/img{\textgreater} Responses of BRAFV600E melanoma cells to vemurafenib were studied at the single-cell level using live-cell imaging and by transcriptional and biochemical profiling to uncover a slowly dividing, de-differentiated cell state associated with drug resistance but inhibitable by drug combinations.

How these two transcription factors are regulated in order to specify these alternate cell fates remains a pivotal question. Here we report that a 14-3-3–binding protein, TAZ (transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif), coactivates Runx2-dependent gene transcription while repressing PPARγ-dependent gene transcription. By modulating TAZ expression in model cell lines, mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and primary MSCs in culture and in zebrafish in vivo, we observed alterations in osteogenic versus adipogenic potential.

Here we report a correlation between QT interval prolongation and T-wave notching in LQTS2 patients and use a novel computational framework to investigate how individual ionic currents, as well as cellular and tissue level factors, contribute to notched T waves. Furthermore, we show that variable expressivity of ECG features observed in LQTS2 patients can be explained by as little as 20\% variation in the levels of ionic conductances that contribute to repolarization reserve.

Despite its resemblance to numerous real-world phenomena, the singular nature of the resultant spatial distribution of each particle precludes the possibility of any a posteriori empirical validation of this random-walk model from data. Here we show that by simply allowing for random speeds, the ballistic terms are regularized and that the diffusion component can be well-approximated via the unscented transform. The result is a computationally efficient yet robust evaluation of the full particle path probabilities and, hence, the parameter likelihoods of this generalized telegraph process. We demonstrate how a population diffusing under such a model can lead to non-Gaussian asymptotic spatial distributions, thereby mimicking the behavior of an ensemble of Lévy walkers.},

Different data modalities-such as EEG, fMRI, LFP, and spike trains-offer different views of the complex systems contributing to neural phenomena. Here, we focus on joint modeling of LFP and spike train data, and present a novel Bayesian method for neural decoding to infer behavioral and experimental conditions. This model performs supervised dual-dimensionality reduction: it learns low-dimensional representations of two different sources of information that not only explain variation in the input data itself, but also predict extra-neuronal outcomes. Despite being one probabilistic unit, the model consists of multiple modules: exponential PCA and wavelet PCA are used for dimensionality reduction in the spike train and LFP modules, respectively; these modules simultaneously interface with a Bayesian binary regression module. We demonstrate how this model may be used for prediction, parametric inference, and identification of influential predictors. In prediction, the hierarchical model outperforms other models trained on LFP alone, spike train alone, and combined LFP and spike train data. We compare two methods for modeling the loading matrix and find them to perform similarly. Finally, model parameters and their posterior distributions yield scientific insights.},

To quantitatively study this process, a time-resolved analysis of cellular dynamics at the single-cell level is an essential prerequisite. One way to generate sufficient amounts of appropriate data is automatic single-cell tracking using time-lapse video microscopy. We describe and apply newly developed computational algorithms that allow for an automated generation of high-content data of single-cell characteristics at high temporal and spatial resolution, together with the reconstruction and statistical evaluation of complete genealogical histories. This methodology has been applied to the particular example of purified primary human HSPCs in bioengineered culture conditions. The combination of genealogical information and dynamic profiles of cellular properties identified a marked symmetry between sibling HSPCs regarding cell cycle time, but also migration speed and growth kinetics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this symmetry of HSPC siblings can be altered by exogenous cues of the local biomimetic microenvironment. Using the example of HSPC growth in biomimetic culture systems, we show that our approach provides a valuable tool for the quantitative analysis of dynamic single-cell features under defined in vitro conditions, allowing for integration of functional and genealogical data. The efficiency and accuracy of our approach pave the way for new and intriguing insights into the organizational principles of developmental patterns and the respective influence of exogenous cues not limited to the study of primary HSPCs.},

	abstract = {A complex hierarchy of genetic interactions converts a single-celled Drosophila melanogaster egg into a multicellular embryo with 14 segments. Previously, von Dassow et al. reported that a mathematical model of the genetic interactions that defined the polarity of segments (the segment polarity network) was robust (von Dassow et al. 2000). As quantitative information about the system was unavailable, parameters were sampled randomly. A surprisingly large fraction of these parameter sets allowed the model to maintain and elaborate on the segment polarity pattern. This robustness is due to the positive feedback of gene products on their own expression, which induces individual cells in a model segment to adopt different stable expression states (bistability) corresponding to different cell types in the segment polarity pattern. A positive feedback loop will only yield multiple stable states when the parameters that describe it satisfy a particular inequality. By testing which random parameter sets satisfy these inequalities, I show that bistability is necessary to form the segment polarity pattern and serves as a strong predictor of which parameter sets will succeed in forming the pattern. Although the original model was robust to parameter variation, it could not reproduce the observed effects of cell division on the pattern of gene expression. I present a modified version that incorporates recent experimental evidence and does successfully mimic the consequences of cell division. The behavior of this modified model can also be understood in terms of bistability in positive feedback of gene expression. I discuss how this topological property of networks provides robust pattern formation and how large changes in parameters can change the specific pattern produced by a network.},

In this study, we have analyzed subpopulations of LSK cells isolated from different regions of the BM and showed that CD150(+)CD48(-)LSK HSCs within the endosteal BM region have superior proliferative capacity and homing efficiency compared with CD150(+)CD48(-)LSK HSCs isolated from the central BM. Furthermore, we show, for the first time, that a subset of CD150(+)CD48(+)LSK progenitor cells, previously defined as B-lymphoid primed hemopoietic cells, are capable of multilineage reconstitution, however, only when isolated from the endosteal region. In addition, we provide evidence for an unrecognized role of CD48 in HSC homing.

Here, we develop such a framework, illustrating its utility by analyzing data from barcoded multipotent cells of the blood system. This application demonstrates that the data require additional paths beyond those found in the classical model, which leads us to propose that hematopoietic differentiation follows a loss of potential mechanism and to suggest further experiments to test this deduction.

Prior to anaphase, most separase is kept inactive by association with securin. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) constitutes another binding partner of human separase, but the functional relevance of this interaction has remained enigmatic. We demonstrate that PP2A stabilizes separase-associated securin by dephosphorylation, while phosphorylation of free securin enhances its polyubiquitylation by the ubiquitin ligase APC/C and proteasomal degradation. Changing PP2A substrate phosphorylation sites to alanines slows degradation of free securin, delays separase activation, lengthens early anaphase, and results in anaphase bridges and DNA damage. In contrast, separase-associated securin is destabilized by introduction of phosphorylation-mimetic aspartates or extinction of separase-associated PP2A activity. G2- or prometaphase-arrested cells suffer from unscheduled activation of separase when endogenous securin is replaced by aspartate-mutant securin. Thus, PP2A-dependent stabilization of separase-associated securin prevents precocious activation of separase during checkpoint-mediated arrests with basal APC/C activity and increases the abruptness and fidelity of sister chromatid separation in anaphase.},

	abstract = {The Wnt/$\beta$-catenin pathway is involved in the regulation of a multitude of physiological processes by controlling the differential expression of target genes. In certain tissues such as the adult liver, the Wnt/$\beta$-catenin pathway can attain different levels of activity due to gradients of Wnt ligands and/or intracellular pathway components like APC. How graded pathway activity is converted into regionally distinct patterns of Wnt/$\beta$-catenin target gene expression is largely unknown. Here, we apply a mathematical modeling approach to investigate the impact of different regulatory mechanisms on target gene expression within Wnt or APC concentration gradients. We develop a minimal model of Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signal transduction and combine it with various mechanisms of target gene regulation. In particular, the effects of activation, inhibition, and an incoherent feedforward loop (iFFL) are compared. To specify activation kinetics, we analyze experimental data that quantify the response of $\beta$-catenin/TCF reporter constructs to different Wnt concentrations, and demonstrate that the induction of these constructs occurs in a cooperative manner with Hill coefficients between 2 and 5. In summary, our study shows that the combination of specific gene regulatory mechanisms with a time-independent gradient of Wnt or APC is sufficient to generate distinct target gene expression patterns as have been experimentally observed in liver. We find that cooperative gene activation in combination with a TCF feedback can establish sharp borders of target gene expression in Wnt or APC gradients. In contrast, the iFFL renders gene expression independent of gradients of the upstream signaling components. Our subsequent analysis of carcinogenic pathway mutations reveals that their impact on gene expression is determined by the gene regulatory mechanism and the APC concentration of the cell in which the mutation occurs.},

However, how Hippo signaling is integrated with other pathways to coordinate these processes remains unclear. Here, we show that the Hippo pathway restricts Wnt/beta-Catenin signaling by promoting an interaction between TAZ and DVL in the cytoplasm. TAZ inhibits the CK1delta/epsilon-mediated phosphorylation of DVL, thereby inhibiting Wnt/beta-Catenin signaling. Abrogation of TAZ levels or Hippo signaling enhances Wnt3A-stimulated DVL phosphorylation, nuclear beta-Catenin, and Wnt target gene expression. Mice lacking Taz develop polycystic kidneys with enhanced cytoplasmic and nuclear beta-Catenin. Moreover, in Drosophila, Hippo signaling modulates Wg target gene expression. These results uncover a cytoplasmic function of TAZ in regulating Wnt signaling and highlight the role of the Hippo pathway in coordinating morphogenetic signaling with growth control.},

	abstract = {Spatial reaction-diffusion models have been employed to describe many emergent phenomena in biological systems. The modelling technique most commonly adopted in the literature implements systems of partial differential equations (PDEs), which assumes there are sufficient densities of particles that a continuum approximation is valid. However, owing to recent advances in computational power, the simulation and therefore postulation, of computationally intensive individual-based models has become a popular way to investigate the effects of noise in reaction-diffusion systems in which regions of low copy numbers exist. The specific stochastic models with which we shall be concerned in this manuscript are referred to as 'compartment-based' or 'on-lattice'. These models are characterized by a discretization of the computational domain into a grid/lattice of 'compartments'. Within each compartment, particles are assumed to be well mixed and are permitted to react with other particles within their compartment or to transfer between neighbouring compartments. Stochastic models provide accuracy, but at the cost of significant computational resources. For models that have regions of both low and high concentrations, it is often desirable, for reasons of efficiency, to employ coupled multi-scale modelling paradigms. In this work, we develop two hybrid algorithms in which a PDE in one region of the domain is coupled to a compartment-based model in the other. Rather than attempting to balance average fluxes, our algorithms answer a more fundamental question: 'how are individual particles transported between the vastly different model descriptions?' First, we present an algorithm derived by carefully redefining the continuous PDE concentration as a probability distribution. While this first algorithm shows very strong convergence to analytical solutions of test problems, it can be cumbersome to simulate. Our second algorithm is a simplified and more efficient implementation of the first, it is derived in the continuum limit over the PDE region alone. We test our hybrid methods for functionality and accuracy in a variety of different scenarios by comparing the averaged simulations with analytical solutions of PDEs for mean concentrations.},

	abstract = {Endocytosis is the process by which cells internalise molecules including nutrient proteins from the extracellular media. In one form, macropinocytosis, the membrane at the cell surface ruffles and folds over to give rise to an internalised vesicle. Negatively charged phospholipids within the membrane called phosphoinositides then undergo a series of transformations that are critical for the correct trafficking of the vesicle within the cell, and which are often pirated by pathogens such as Salmonella. Advanced fluorescent video microscopy imaging now allows the detailed observation and quantification of these events in live cells over time. Here we use these observations as a basis for building differential equation models of the transformations. An initial investigation of these interactions was modelled with reaction rates proportional to the sum of the concentrations of the individual constituents. A first order linear system for the concentrations results. The structure of the system enables analytical expressions to be obtained and the problem becomes one of determining the reaction rates which generate the observed data plots. We present results with reaction rates which capture the general behaviour of the reactions so that we now have a complete mathematical model of phosphoinositide transformations that fits the experimental observations. Some excellent fits are obtained with modulated exponential functions; however, these are not solutions of the linear system. The question arises as to how the model may be modified to obtain a system whose solution provides a more accurate fit.},

High-content cellular assays seek to bridge this gap by capturing broad information about the cellular physiology of drug action. Here, we present a method of predicting the general therapeutic classes into which various psychoactive drugs fall, based on high-content statistical categorization of gene expression profiles induced by these drugs. When we used the classification tree and random forest supervised classification algorithms to analyze microarray data, we derived general "efficacy profiles" of biomarker gene expression that correlate with anti-depressant, antipsychotic and opioid drug action on primary human neurons in vitro. These profiles were used as predictive models to classify naïve in vitro drug treatments with 83.3\% (random forest) and 88.9\% (classification tree) accuracy. Thus, the detailed information contained in genomic expression data is sufficient to match the physiological effect of a novel drug at the cellular level with its clinical relevance. This capacity to identify therapeutic efficacy on the basis of gene expression signatures in vitro has potential utility in drug discovery and drug target validation.},

	abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cell lineage choices are decided by genetic networks that are turned ON/OFF in a switch-like manner. However, prior to lineage commitment, genes are primed at low expression levels. Understanding the underlying molecular circuitry in terms of how it governs both a primed state and, at the other extreme, a committed state is of relevance not only to hematopoiesis but also to developmental systems in general. We develop a computational model for the hematopoietic erythroid-myeloid lineage decision, which is determined by a genetic switch involving the genes PU.1 and GATA-1. Dynamical models based upon known interactions between these master genes, such as mutual antagonism and autoregulation, fail to make the system bistable, a desired feature for robust lineage determination. We therefore suggest a new mechanism involving a cofactor that is regulated as well as recruited by one of the master genes to bind to the antagonistic partner that is necessary for bistability and hence switch-like behavior. An interesting fallout from this architecture is that suppression of the cofactor through external means can lead to a loss of cooperativity, and hence to a primed state for PU.1 and GATA-1. The PU.1-GATA-1 switch also interacts with another mutually antagonistic pair, C/EBPalpha-FOG-1. The latter pair inherits the state of its upstream master genes and further reinforces the decision due to several feedback loops, thereby leading to irreversible commitment. The genetic switch, which handles the erythroid-myeloid lineage decision, is an example of a network that implements both a primed and a committed state by regulating cooperativity through recruitment of cofactors. Perturbing the feedback between the master regulators and downstream targets suggests potential reprogramming strategies. The approach points to a framework for lineage commitment studies in general and could aid the search for lineage-determining genes.},

Here, we use the embryonic neural crest (NC) in tandem with theoretical studies to evaluate model mechanisms of long-distance cell migration. We find that a simple chemotaxis model is insufficient to explain our experimental data. Instead, model simulations predict that NC cell migration requires leading cells to respond to long-range guidance signals and trailing cells to short-range cues in order to maintain a directed, multicellular stream. Experiments confirm differences in leading versus trailing NC cell subpopulations, manifested in unique cell orientation and gene expression patterns that respond to non-linear tissue growth of the migratory domain. Ablation experiments that delete the trailing NC cell subpopulation reveal that leading NC cells distribute all along the migratory pathway and develop a leading/trailing cellular orientation and gene expression profile that is predicted by model simulations. Transplantation experiments and model predictions that move trailing NC cells to the migratory front, or vice versa, reveal that cells adopt a gene expression profile and cell behaviors corresponding to the new position within the migratory stream. These results offer a mechanistic model in which leading cells create and respond to a cell-induced chemotactic gradient and transmit guidance information to trailing cells that use short-range signals to move in a directional manner.},

In the invasive front of pancreatic tumors, a distinct subpopulation of CD133(+) CXCR4(+) cancer stem cells was identified that determines the metastatic phenotype of the individual tumor. Depletion of the cancer stem cell pool for these migrating cancer stem cells virtually abrogated the metastatic phenotype of pancreatic tumors without affecting their tumorigenic potential. In conclusion, we demonstrate that a subpopulation of migrating CD133(+) CXCR4(+) cancer stem cells is essential for tumor metastasis.

We discuss an approach to studying population structure (principal components analysis) that was first applied to genetic data by Cavalli-Sforza and colleagues. We place the method on a solid statistical footing, using results from modern statistics to develop formal significance tests. We also uncover a general "phase change" phenomenon about the ability to detect structure in genetic data, which emerges from the statistical theory we use, and has an important implication for the ability to discover structure in genetic data: for a fixed but large dataset size, divergence between two populations (as measured, for example, by a statistic like FST) below a threshold is essentially undetectable, but a little above threshold, detection will be easy. This means that we can predict the dataset size needed to detect structure.},

	abstract = {TGF-$\beta$ can act as a tumor suppressor at early stages of cancer progression and as a tumor promoter at later stages. The E3 ubiquitin ligase Arkadia (RNF111) is a critical component of the TGF-$\beta$ signaling pathway, being required for a subset of responses, those mediated by Smad3-Smad4 complexes. It acts by mediating ligand-induced degradation of Ski and SnoN (SKIL), which are 2 potent transcriptional repressors. Here, we investigate the role of Arkadia in cancer using model systems to address both potential tumor-suppressive and tumor-promoting roles. Stable reexpression of Arkadia in lung carcinoma NCI-H460 cells, which we show contain a hemizygous nonsense mutation in the Arkadia/RNF111 gene, efficiently restored TGF-$\beta$-induced Smad3-dependent transcription, and substantially decreased the ability of these cells to grow in soft agar in vitro. However, it had no effect on tumor growth in vivo in mouse models. Moreover, loss of Arkadia in cancer cell lines and human tumors is rare, arguing against a prominent tumor-suppressive role. In contrast, we have uncovered a potent tumor-promoting function for Arkadia. Using 3 different cancer cell lines whose tumorigenic properties are driven by TGF-$\beta$ signaling, we show that loss of Arkadia function, either by overexpression of dominant negative Arkadia or by siRNA-induced knockdown, substantially inhibited lung colonization in tail vein injection experiments in immunodeficient mice. Our findings indicate that Arkadia is not critical for regulating tumor growth per se, but is required for the early stages of cancer cell colonization at the sites of metastasis.},

Although experimental studies are beginning to reveal molecular mechanisms underlying such control, there is still very little known about the control strategies themselves. Here, we consider how secreted negative feedback factors ("chalones") may be used to control the output of multistage cell lineages, as exemplified by the actions of GDF11 and activin in a self-renewing neural tissue, the mammalian olfactory epithelium (OE). We begin by specifying performance objectives-what, precisely, is being controlled, and to what degree-and go on to calculate how well different types of feedback configurations, feedback sensitivities, and tissue architectures achieve control. Ultimately, we show that many features of the OE-the number of feedback loops, the cellular processes targeted by feedback, even the location of progenitor cells within the tissue-fit with expectations for the best possible control. In so doing, we also show that certain distinctions that are commonly drawn among cells and molecules-such as whether a cell is a stem cell or transit-amplifying cell, or whether a molecule is a growth inhibitor or stimulator-may be the consequences of control, and not a reflection of intrinsic differences in cellular or molecular character.},

Despite the fundamental importance of physical, face-to-face social ties in the functioning of cities, these connectivity networks are not explicitly observed in their entirety. Attempts at estimating them often rely on unrealistic over-simplifications such as the assumption of spatial homogeneity. Here we propose a mathematical model of human interactions in terms of a local strategy of maximizing the number of beneficial connections attainable under the constraint of limited individual travelling-time budgets. By incorporating census and openly available online multi-modal transport data, we are able to characterize the connectivity of geometrically and topologically complex cities. Beyond providing a candidate measure of greatness, this model allows one to quantify and assess the impact of transport developments, population growth, and other infrastructure and demographic changes on a city. Supported by validations of gross domestic product and human immunodeficiency virus infection rates across US metropolitan areas, we illustrate the effect of changes in local and city-wide connectivities by considering the economic impact of two contemporary inter- and intra-city transport developments in the UK: High Speed 2 and London Crossrail . This derivation of the model suggests that the scaling of different urban indicators with population size has an explicitly mechanistic origin.},

	abstract = {The microenvironment is a key regulator of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and is a likely source of extracellular factors that control stem cell fate. A better understanding of these microenvironmental factors may come from investigations of developmental cell fate determination in which the critical roles of cell-cell interactions of multipotential cells have been shown. The Wnt gene family is known to regulate the cell fate and cell-cell interactions of multipotential cells in a variety of tissues. Expression of Wnts and of their putative receptors encoded by murine homologs of the Drosophila frizzled gene in hematopoietic tissues was examined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Wnt-5a and Wnt-10b were expressed in day-11 murine yolk sac, day-14 fetal liver, and fetal liver AA4+ cells. The expression profiles of four murine frizzled homologs, Mfz3-7, were nearly identical to that of Wnt-5a and Wnt-10b. Notably, Wnt-10b was expressed in the fetal liver AA4+ Sca+ c-kit+ flASK) HSC population. A role for Wnts in HSC fate determination was studied by treatment of HSC populations in culture with soluble WNT proteins. The addition of conditioned media from cells transfected with Wnt-1, Wnt-5a, or Wnt-10b cDNAs to cultures of flASK cells stimulated a sevenfold, eightfold, and 11-fold expansion in cell number, respectively, relative to control media. Removal of WNT-5a from this media by immunodepletion depleted the stimulatory activity from the media, whereas addition of a partially purified WNT-5a stimulated a fivefold expansion relative to control cells. Transduction of flASK cells with a retrovirus bearing a Wnt-5a cDNA enhanced proliferation. We conclude that WNTs stimulate the survival/proliferation of hematopoietic progenitors, demonstrating that WNTs comprise a novel class of hematopoietic cell regulators.},

From 1972 to 2001, Geospiza fortis (medium ground finch) and Geospiza scandens (cactus finch) changed several times in body size and two beak traits. Natural selection occurred frequently in both species and varied from unidirectional to oscillating, episodic to gradual. Hybridization occurred repeatedly though rarely, resulting in elevated phenotypic variances in G. scandens and a change in beak shape. The phenotypic states of both species at the end of the 30-year study could not have been predicted at the beginning. Continuous, long-term studies are needed to detect and interpret rare but important events and nonuniform evolutionary change.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Frizzled (Fz) 2 and Fz7, together with Fz1, form a distinct subfamily within the Frizzled family of Wnt receptors. Using targeted gene deletion, we show that: \textit{Fz7$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}textminus/{\textbackslash}textminus}}$} mice exhibit tail truncation and kinking with 100\% penetrance and ventricular septal defects (VSDs) with {\textbackslash}textasciitilde15\% penetrance; \textit{Fz2$^{\textrm{+/{\textbackslash}textminus}}$;Fz7$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}textminus/{\textbackslash}textminus}}$} mice exhibit VSDs with {\textbackslash}textasciitilde50\% penetrance and cleft palate with less than 10\% penetrance; and \textit{Fz2$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}textminus/{\textbackslash}textminus}}$;Fz7$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}textminus/{\textbackslash}textminus}}$} mice exhibit convergent extension defects and mid-gestational lethality with 100\% penetrance. When \textit{Fz2} and/or \textit{Fz7} mutations are combined with mutations in \textit{Vangl2, Dvl3, Wnt3a, Wnt5a} or \textit{Wnt11}, an increased frequency of VSDs is observed with \textit{Dvl3, Wnt3a} and \textit{Wnt11}; an increased frequency of palate closure defects is observed with \textit{Vangl2}; and early lethality and enhanced tail shortening are observed with \textit{Wnt5a}. To assess the signaling pathways that underlie these and other Frizzled-mediated genetic interactions, we used transfected mammalian cells to analyze (1) canonical Wnt signaling induced by all pairwise combinations of the ten mouse Frizzleds and the 19 mouse Wnts and (2) localization of each Frizzled at cell-cell junctional complexes formed by mouse Celsr1, a likely indicator of competence for planar cell polarity signaling. These in vitro experiments indicate that Fz2 and Fz7 are competent to signal via the canonical pathway. Taken together, the data suggest that genetic interactions between \textit{Fz2, Fz7} and \textit{Vangl2, Dvl3} and Wnt genes reflect interactions among different signaling pathways in developmental processes that are highly sensitive to perturbations in Frizzled signaling.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Misregulation of Wnt signaling is implicated in many human diseases, making this pathway an intense area of research in industry as well as academia. In this review, we explore our current understanding of the molecular steps involved in the transduction of a Wnt signal. We will focus on how the critical Wnt pathway component, $\beta$-catenin, is in a “futile cycle” of constant synthesis and degradation and how this cycle is disrupted upon pathway activation. We describe the role of the Wnt pathway in major human cancers and in the control of stem cell self-renewal in the developing organism and in adults. Finally, we describe well-accepted criteria that have been proposed as evidence for the involvement of a molecule in regulating the canonical Wnt pathway.},

This method allows the immediate generation of targeted mouse mutants from genetically modified ES cell clones, in contrast to the standard protocol, which involves the production of chimeras and several breeding steps. To provide a baseline for the analysis of ES mouse mutants, we performed a phenotypic characterization of wild-type B6129S6F(1) ES mice in relation to controls of the same age, sex, and genotype raised from normal matings. The comparison of 90 morphological, physiological, and behavioral parameters revealed elevated body weight and hematocrit as the only major difference of ES mice, which exhibited an otherwise normal phenotype. We further demonstrate that ES mouse mutants can be produced from mutant hybrid ES cells and analyzed within a period of only 4 months. Thus, ES mouse technology is a valid research tool for rapidly elucidating gene function in vivo.},

	abstract = {The image of the "epigenetic landscape", with a series of branching valleys and ridges depicting stable cellular states and the barriers between those states, has been a popular visual metaphor for cell lineage specification - especially in light of the recent discovery that terminally differentiated adult cells can be reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells or into alternative cell lineages. However the question of whether the epigenetic landscape can be mapped out quantitatively to provide a predictive model of cellular differentiation remains largely unanswered. Here we derive a simple deterministic path-integral quasi-potential, based on the kinetic parameters of a gene network regulating cell fate, and show that this quantity is minimized along a temporal trajectory in the state space of the gene network, thus providing a marker of directionality for cell differentiation processes. We then use the derived quasi-potential as a measure of "elevation" to quantitatively map the epigenetic landscape, on which trajectories flow "downhill" from any location. Stochastic simulations confirm that the elevation of this computed landscape correlates to the likelihood of occurrence of particular cell fates, with well-populated low-lying "valleys" representing stable cellular states and higher "ridges" acting as barriers to transitions between the stable states. This quantitative map of the epigenetic landscape underlying cell fate choice provides mechanistic insights into the "forces" that direct cellular differentiation in the context of physiological development, as well as during artificially induced cell lineage reprogramming. Our generalized approach to mapping the landscape is applicable to non-gradient gene regulatory systems for which an analytical potential function cannot be derived, and also to high-dimensional gene networks. Rigorous quantification of the gene regulatory circuits that govern cell lineage choice and subsequent mapping of the epigenetic landscape can potentially help identify optimal routes of cell fate reprogramming.},

It can be used to determine whether a system is stable (returns to equilibrium after small perturbations of the population abundances), reactive (perturbations are initially amplified before damping out), and to determine the response of any individual species to perturbations of environmental parameters. However, several studies show that small errors in estimating the entries of the community matrix translate into large errors in predicting individual species responses. Here, we ask whether there are properties of complex communities one can still predict using only a crude, order-of-magnitude estimate of the community matrix entries. Using empirical data, randomly generated community matrices, and those generated by the Allometric Trophic Network model, we show that the stability and reactivity properties of systems can be predicted with good accuracy. We also provide theoretical insight into when and why our crude approximations are expected to yield an accurate description of communities. Our results indicate that even rough estimates of interaction strengths can be useful for assessing global properties of large systems.},

To investigate clinically relevant aspects of hematopoietic aging, we compared the clonal output of thousands of genetically barcoded HSPCs in aged vs young macaques after autologous transplantation. Aged macaques showed delayed emergence of output from multipotent (MP) clones, with persistence of lineage-biased clones for many months after engraftment. In contrast to murine aging models reporting persistence of myeloid-biased HSPCs, aged macaques demonstrated persistent output from both B-cell and myeloid-biased clones. Clonal expansions of MP, myeloid-biased, and B-biased clones occurred in aged macaques, providing a potential model for human clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate prognosis. These results suggest that long-term MP HSPC output is impaired in aged macaques, resulting in differences in the kinetics and lineage reconstitution patterns between young and aged primates in an autologous transplantation setting.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We find that HSPCs preferentially localize in endosteal zones, where most closely interact with sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal bone marrow microvessels, which form a distinctive circulatory system. In situ tissue analysis reveals that HSPCs exhibit a hypoxic profile, defined by strong retention of pimonidazole and expression of HIF-1α, regardless of localization throughout the bone marrow, adjacency to vascular structures or cell-cycle status. These studies argue that the characteristic hypoxic state of HSPCs is not solely the result of a minimally oxygenated niche but may be partially regulated by cell-specific mechanisms.},

The same method allows us furthermore to perform a statistical test for correlated evolution between genes. Where such correlations exist within the osmotic stress response pathway of S. cerevisae, we have used this in order to predict and subsequently test for the presence of physical protein-protein interactions in an attempt to detect novel interactions. Finally we assess the relevance of observed evolutionary correlations in predicting protein interactions in light of the experimental results.

While much is known about the molecular basis of pluripotency, the mechanisms of differentiation remain unclear. Here, we profile individual mouse embryonic stem cells as they progress along the neuronal lineage. We observe that cells pass from the pluripotent state to the neuronal state via an intermediate epiblast-like state. However, analysis of the rate at which cells enter and exit these observed cell states using a hidden Markov model indicates the presence of a chain of unobserved molecular states that each cell transits through stochastically in sequence. This chain of hidden states allows individual cells to record their position on the differentiation trajectory, thereby encoding a simple form of cellular memory. We suggest a statistical mechanics interpretation of these results that distinguishes between functionally distinct cellular "macrostates" and functionally similar molecular "microstates" and propose a model of stem cell differentiation as a non-Markov stochastic process.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW:Steady-state hematopoiesis in adult bone marrow requires the maintenance of a small pool of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) by self-renewing symmetric division. HSCs can be divided into potent rarely dividing HSCs which function as long-term reserve and more proliferative HSCs which contribute to maintaining the blood and immune cell pool. Extrinsic instructions provided by unique microenvironments (niches) regulate the fate of individual HSCs and progenitors. This review discusses the latest findings in respect to the organization and function of these niches. RECENT FINDINGS:It has recently emerged that mesenchymal stem cells, various osteoblastic progenitors and sinusoidal endothelial cells all critically regulate HSCs within niches. Each of these niche cells expresses different arrays of signaling proteins which differentially regulate HSCs and progenitors. HSCs have been reported in two types of niches. However, as osteoblastic/mesenchymal niches and perivascular niches overlap anatomically, this makes the dichotomy between osteoblastic niches for quiescent HSCs and endothelial niches for more proliferative HSCs a too simplistic model. Indeed local blood perfusion in a niche alone can functionally separate HSC populations. SUMMARY:The fate of each individual HSC is likely to be the result of the unique balance between signals elicited by proteins expressed by mesenchymal/osteoblastic progenitors, sinusoidal endothelial cells and physicochemical cues such as local blood perfusion and hypoxia in each individual niche. More sophisticated three-dimensional fluorescence microscopy techniques on whole mount bone fragments should provide new insights in the spatial organization of niches relative to bone and microcirculation in the bone marrow.},

	abstract = {Author Summary The function of proteins is frequently modulated by chemical modifications introduced after translation from RNA. These post-translational modifications (PTMs) have been shown to also influence the interaction between proteins carrying them. We tested whether specific PTM-types characterized by attaching different chemical groups are associated with proteins with characteristic and possibly strategic positions within the network of all protein interactions in cellular systems. Based on network-theoretic analyses of PTMs in the context of protein interaction networks of nine selected species, we indeed observed distinctive properties of twelve PTM-types tested. Phosphorylation was found associated with proteins in central locations with the broadest interaction scope, while glycosylation was more prominent in proteins at the periphery of the web of all protein interactions. The involvement in disease processes of human proteins undergoing PTMs was also found associated with characteristic protein interaction network properties. Our study highlights common and specific roles of the various PTM types in the orchestration of molecular interactions in cells.},

By studying regeneration of hair follicles in response to patterned hair plucking, we demonstrate that organ-level quorum sensing allows coordinated responses to skin injury. Plucking hair at different densities leads to a regeneration of up to five times more neighboring, unplucked resting hairs, indicating activation of a collective decision-making process. Through data modeling, the range of the quorum signal was estimated to be on the order of 1 mm, greater than expected for a diffusible molecular cue. Molecular and genetic analysis uncovered a two-step mechanism, where release of CCL2 from injured hairs leads to recruitment of TNF-α-secreting macrophages, which accumulate and signal to both plucked and unplucked follicles. By coupling immune response with regeneration, this mechanism allows skin to respond predictively to distress, disregarding mild injury, while meeting stronger injury with full-scale cooperative activation of stem cells.},

The skin's elixir for maintaining tissue homeostasis, regenerating hair, and repairing the epidermis after injury is its stem cells, which reside in the adult hair follicle, sebaceous gland, and epidermis. Stem cells have the remarkable capacity to both self-perpetuate and also give rise to the differentiating cells that constitute one or more tissues. In recent years, scientists have begun to uncover the properties of skin stem cells and unravel the mysteries underlying their remarkable capacity to perform these feats. In this paper, I outline the basic lineages of the skin epithelia and review some of the major findings about mammalian skin epithelial stem cells that have emerged in the past five years.},

	abstract = {Author Summary Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can proliferate indefinitely by keeping pluripotency, i.e., the ability to differentiate into any cell-lineage. ESCs, therefore, have been the focus of intense biological and medical interests. A remarkable feature of ESCs is their phenotypic heterogeneity: ESCs show large cell-to-cell fluctuation in the expression level of Nanog, which is a key factor to maintain pluripotency. Since Nanog regulates many genes in ESCs, this fluctuation should seriously affect individual cells when they start differentiation. In this paper we analyze this phenotypic fluctuation by simulating the stochastic dynamics of gene network in ESCs. The model takes account of the mutually interrelated processes of gene regulation such as binding/unbinding of transcription factors, formation/dissolution of transcription apparatus, and histone-code modification. We show the distribution of timescales of these processes is decisively important to characterize the dynamical behavior of the gene network, and that the slow formation/dissolution of transcription apparatus at the Nanog locus explains the observed large fluctuation of ESCs. The epigenetic landscapes are calculated based on the stochastic simulation, and the role of the phenotypic fluctuation in the differentiation process is analyzed through the landscape picture.},

Our results revealed that the transcription activity of autophagy-related genes had a substantial increase when endothelial cells (ECs) specified into pre-HSCs, and the upregulation of autophagy-essential genes correlated with reduced NOTCH signaling in pre-HSCs, suggesting the autophagy activity may be greatly enhanced during pre-HSC specification from endothelial precursors.

The instrument is based on inductively coupled plasma time-of-flight mass spectrometry and comprises a three-aperture plasma-vacuum interface, a dc quadrupole turning optics for decoupling ions from neutral components, an rf quadrupole ion guide discriminating against low-mass dominant plasma ions, a point-to-parallel focusing dc quadrupole doublet, an orthogonal acceleration reflectron analyzer, a discrete dynode fast ion detector, and an 8-bit 1 GHz digitizer.

	abstract = {Understanding how complex phenotypes arise from individual molecules and their interactions is a primary challenge in biology that computational approaches are poised to tackle. We report a whole-cell computational model of the life cycle of the human pathogen Mycoplasma genitalium that includes all of its molecular components and their interactions. An integrative approach to modeling that combines diverse mathematics enabled the simultaneous inclusion of fundamentally different cellular processes and experimental measurements. Our whole-cell model accounts for all annotated gene functions and was validated against a broad range of data. The model provides insights into many previously unobserved cellular behaviors, including in vivo rates of protein-DNA association and an inverse relationship between the durations of DNA replication initiation and replication. In addition, experimental analysis directed by model predictions identified previously undetected kinetic parameters and biological functions. We conclude that comprehensive whole-cell models can be used to facilitate biological discovery.},

	abstract = {Bone marrow vascular niches sustain hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and are drastically remodeled in leukemia to support pathological functions. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells produce angiogenic factors, which likely contribute to this remodeling, but anti-angiogenic therapies do not improve AML patient outcomes. Using intravital microscopy, we found that AML progression leads to differential remodeling of vasculature in central and endosteal bone marrow regions. Endosteal AML cells produce pro-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic cytokines and gradually degrade endosteal endothelium, stromal cells, and osteoblastic cells, whereas central marrow remains vascularized and splenic vascular niches expand. Remodeled endosteal regions have reduced capacity to support non-leukemic HSCs, correlating with loss of normal hematopoiesis. Preserving endosteal endothelium with the small molecule deferoxamine or a genetic approach rescues HSCs loss, promotes chemotherapeutic efficacy, and enhances survival. These findings suggest that preventing degradation of the endosteal vasculature may improve current paradigms for treating AML.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Waddington’s epigenetic landscape, a famous metaphor in developmental biology, depicts how a stem cell progresses from an undifferentiated phenotype to a differentiated one. The concept of “landscape” in the context of dynamical systems theory represents a high-dimensional space, in which each cell phenotype is considered as an “attractor” that is determined by interactions between multiple molecular players, and is buffered against environmental fluctuations. In addition, biological noise is thought to play an important role during these cell-fate decisions and in fact controls transitions between different phenotypes. Here, we discuss the phenotypic transitions in cancer from a dynamical systems perspective and invoke the concept of “cancer attractors”—hidden stable states of the underlying regulatory network that are not occupied by normal cells. Phenotypic transitions in cancer occur at varying levels depending on the context. Using epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cancer stem-like properties, metabolic reprogramming and the emergence of therapy resistance as examples, we illustrate how phenotypic plasticity in cancer cells enables them to acquire hybrid phenotypes (such as hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal and hybrid metabolic phenotypes) that tend to be more aggressive and notoriously resilient to therapies such as chemotherapy and androgen-deprivation therapy. Furthermore, we highlight multiple factors that may give rise to phenotypic plasticity in cancer cells, such as (a) multi-stability or oscillatory behaviors governed by underlying regulatory networks involved in cell-fate decisions in cancer cells, and (b) network rewiring due to conformational dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) that are highly enriched in cancer cells. We conclude by discussing why a therapeutic approach that promotes “recanalization”, i.e., the exit from “cancer attractors” and re-entry into “normal attractors”, is more likely to succeed rather than a conventional approach that targets individual molecules/pathways.},

	abstract = {Anaemia is a common haematologic side effect of dose-dense multi-cycle cytotoxic polychemotherapy requiring erythrocyte transfusions or erythropoietin (EPO) administration. To simulate the effectiveness of different EPO application schedules, we performed both modelling of erythropoiesis under chemotherapy and pharmacokinetic and dynamic modelling of EPO applications in the framework of a single comprehensive biomathematical model. For this purpose, a cell kinetic model of bone marrow erythropoiesis was developed that is based on a set of differential compartment equations describing proliferation and maturation of erythropoietic cell stages. The system is regulated by several feedback loops comprising those mediated by EPO. We added a model of EPO absorption after injection at different sites and a pharmacokinetic model of EPO derivatives to account for the effects of external EPO applications. Chemotherapy is modelled by a transient depletion of bone marrow cell stages. Unknown model parameters were determined by fitting the predictions of the model to data sets of circulating erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit, percentage of reticulocytes or EPO serum concentrations derived from the literature or cooperating clinical study groups. Parameter fittings resulted in a good agreement of model and data. Depending on site of injection and derivative (Alfa, Beta, Delta, Darbepoetin), nine groups of EPO applications were distinguished differing in either absorption kinetics or pharmacokinetics. Finally, eight different chemotherapy protocols were modelled. The model was validated on the basis of scenarios not used for parameter fitting. Simulations were performed to analyze the impact of EPO applications on the risk of anaemia during chemotherapy. We conclude that we established a model of erythropoiesis under chemotherapy that explains a large set of time series data under EPO and chemotherapy applications. It allows predictions regarding yet untested EPO schedules. Prospective clinical studies are needed to validate model predictions and to explore the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed schedules.},

In the dominantly inherited form, one mutation is inherited via the germinal cells and the second occurs in somatic cells. In the nonhereditary form, both mutations occur in somatic cells. The second mutation produces an average of three retinoblastomas per individual inheriting the first mutation. Using Poisson statistics, one can calculate that this number (three) can explain the occasional gene carrier who gets no tumor, those who develop only unilateral tumors, and those who develop bilateral tumors, as well as explaining instances of multiple tumors in one eye. This value for the mean number of tumors occurring in genetic carriers may be used to estimate the mutation rate for each mutation. The germinal and somatic rates for the first, and the somatic rate for the second, mutation, are approximately equal. The germinal mutation may arise in some instances from a delayed mutation.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer patients have an anomalously high rate of relapse many years–up to 25 years–after apparently curative surgery removed the primary tumour. Disease progression during the intervening years between resection and relapse is poorly understood. There is evidence that the disease persists as dangerous, tiny metastases that remain at a growth restricted, clinically undetectable size until a transforming event restarts growth. This is the starting point for our study, where patients who have metastases that are all tiny and growth-restricted are said to have cancer dormancy. Can long-term follow-up relapse data from breast cancer patients be used to extract knowledge about the progression of the undetected disease? Here, we evaluate whether this is the case by introducing and analysing four simple mathematical models of cancer dormancy. These models extend the common assumption that a random transforming event, such as a mutation, can restart growth of a tiny, growth-restricted metastasis; thereafter, cancer dormancy progresses to detectable metastasis. We find that physiopathological details, such as the number of random transforming events that metastases must undergo to escape from growth restriction, cannot be extracted from relapse data. This result is unsurprising. However, the same analysis suggested a natural question that does have a surprising answer: why are interesting trends in long-term relapse data not more commonly observed? Further, our models indicate that (a) therapies which induce growth restriction among metastases but do not prevent increases in metastases' tumourigenicity may introduce a time post-surgery when more patients are prone to relapse; and (b), if a number of facts about disease progression are first established, how relapse data might be used to estimate clinically relevant variables, such as the likely numbers of undetected growth-restricted metastases. This work is a necessary, early step in building a quantitative mechanistic understanding of cancer dormancy.},

However, GMT alone appears insufficient in human fibroblasts, at least in vitro. Here, we show that GMT plus ESRRG and MESP1 induced global cardiac gene-expression and phenotypic shifts in human fibroblasts derived from embryonic stem cells, fetal heart, and neonatal skin. Adding Myocardin and ZFPM2 enhanced reprogramming, including sarcomere formation, calcium transients, and action potentials, although the efficiency remained low. Human iCM reprogramming was epigenetically stable. Furthermore, we found that transforming growth factor $\beta$ signaling was important for, and improved the efficiency of, human iCM reprogramming. These findings demonstrate that human fibroblasts can be directly reprogrammed toward the cardiac lineage, and lay the foundation for future refinements in vitro and in vivo.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Histopathologic knowledge that extensive heterogeneity exists between and within tumors has been confirmed and deepened recently by molecular studies. However, the impact of tumor heterogeneity on prognosis and treatment remains as poorly understood as ever. Using a hybrid multiscale mathematical model of tumor growth in vascularized tissue, we investigated the selection pressures exerted by spatial and temporal variations in tumor microenvironment and the resulting phenotypic adaptations. A key component of this model is normal and tumor metabolism and its interaction with microenvironmental factors. The metabolic phenotype of tumor cells is plastic, and microenvironmental selection leads to increased tumor glycolysis and decreased pH. Once this phenotype emerges, the tumor dramatically changes its behavior due to acid-mediated invasion, an effect that depends on both variations in the tumor cell phenotypes and their spatial distribution within the tumor. In early stages of growth, tumors are stratified, with the most aggressive cells developing within the interior of the tumor. These cells then grow to the edge of the tumor and invade into the normal tissue using acidosis. Simulations suggest that diffusible cytotoxic treatments, such as chemotherapy, may increase the metabolic aggressiveness of a tumor due to drug-mediated selection. Chemotherapy removes the metabolic stratification of the tumor and allows more aggressive cells to grow toward blood vessels and normal tissue. Antiangiogenic therapy also selects for aggressive phenotypes due to degradation of the tumor microenvironment, ultimately resulting in a more invasive tumor. In contrast, pH buffer therapy slows down the development of aggressive tumors, but only if administered when the tumor is still stratified. Overall, findings from this model highlight the risks of cytotoxic and antiangiogenic treatments in the context of tumor heterogeneity resulting from a selection for more aggressive behaviors.

	abstract = {Myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) is a hematologic malignancy characterized by the clonal outgrowth of hematopoietic cells with a somatically acquired mutation most commonly in JAK2 (JAK2V617F). This mutation endows upon myeloid progenitors cytokine independent growth and consequently leads to excessive production of myeloid lineage cells. It has been previously suggested that inflammation may play a role in the clonal evolution of JAK2V617F mutants. In particular, it is possible that one or more cellular kinetic parameters of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are affected by inflammation, such as division or death rates of cells, and the probability of HSC differentiation. This suggests a mechanism that can steer the outcome of the cellular competition in favor of the mutants, initiating the disease. In this paper we create a number of mathematical evolutionary models, from very abstract to more concrete, that describe cellular competition in the context of inflammation. It is possible to build a model axiomatically, where only very general assumptions are imposed on the modeling components and no arbitrary (and generally unknown) functional forms are used, and still generate a set of testable predictions. In particular, we show that, if HSC death is negligible, the evolutionary advantage of mutant cells can only be conferred by an increase in differentiation probability of HSCs in the presence of inflammation, and if death plays a significant role in the dynamics, an additional mechanism may be an increase of HSC's division-to-death ratio in the presence of inflammation. Further, we show that in the presence of inflammation, the wild type cell population is predicted to shrink under inflammation (even in the absence of mutants). Finally, it turns out that if only the differentiation probability is affected by the inflammation, then the resulting steady state population of wild type cells will contain a relatively smaller percentage of HSCs under inflammation. If the division-to-death rate is also affected, then the percentage of HSCs under inflammation can either decrease or increase, depending on other parameters.},

Here, we examined the effect of macromolecular crowding on ERK MAPK phosphorylation by MEK MAPKK. Addition of polyethylene glycol-6000 (PEG-6000) as a crowder to mimic intracellular environments, elicited a biphasic response to the overall ERK phosphorylation rate. Furthermore, probability of processive phosphorylation (processivity) of tyrosine and threonine residues within the activation loop on ERK increased non-linearly for increasing PEG-6000 concentration. Based on the experimental data, we developed for the first time a mathematical model integrating all of the effects of thermodynamic activity, viscosity, and processivity in crowded media, and found that ERK phosphorylation is transition-state-limited reaction. The mathematical model allows accurate estimation of the effects of macromolecular crowding on a wide range of reaction kinetics, from transition-state-limited to diffusion-limited reactions.},

Its outermost protective layer, the epidermis, is comprised of multiple cell layers that are derived from a single-layered ectoderm during development. Using a new stochastic, multi-scale computational modelling framework, the anisotropic subcellular element method, we investigate the role of cell morphology and biophysical cell-cell interactions in the formation of this layered structure. This three-dimensional framework describes interactions between collections of hundreds to thousands of cells and (i) accounts for intracellular structure and morphology, (ii) easily incorporates complex cell-cell interactions and (iii) can be efficiently implemented on parallel architectures. We use this approach to construct a model of the developing epidermis that accounts for the internal polarity of ectodermal cells and their columnar morphology. Using this model, we show that cell detachment, which has been previously suggested to have a role in this process, leads to unpredictable, randomized stratification and that this cannot be abrogated by adjustment of cell-cell adhesion interaction strength. Polarized distribution of cell adhesion proteins, motivated by epithelial polarization, can however eliminate this detachment, and in conjunction with asymmetric cell division lead to robust and predictable development.},

We find that favoring asymmetric (disassortative) links is key to preserving the topology and functionality of the declining network. Based on our findings, we tested a model of network decline that combines an asymmetric disassembly process for contraction with a preferential attachment process for regrowth. Our simulation results indicate that the model can explain robustness under decline even if the total population of nodes contracts by more than an order of magnitude, in line with our observations for the empirical network. These findings suggest that disassembly mechanisms are not simply assembly mechanisms in reverse and that our model is relevant to understanding the process of decline and collapse in a broad range of biological, technological, and financial networks.},

Despite the significance for craniofacial development, how genetic programs drive this regionalization remains incompletely understood. Here we use combinatorial labeling of zebrafish cranial neural crest-derived cells (CNCCs) to define global gene expression along the dorsoventral axis of the developing arches. Intersection of region-specific transcriptomes with expression changes in response to signaling perturbations demonstrates complex roles for Endothelin 1 (Edn1) signaling in the intermediate joint-forming region, yet a surprisingly minor role in ventralmost regions. Analysis of co-variance across multiple sequencing experiments further reveals clusters of co-regulated genes, with \textit{in situ} hybridization confirming the domain-specific expression of novel genes. We then created loss-of-function alleles for 12 genes and uncovered antagonistic functions of two new Edn1 targets, \textit{follistatin a} (\textit{fsta}) and \textit{emx2}, in regulating cartilaginous joints in the hyoid arch. Our unbiased discovery and functional analysis of genes with regional expression in zebrafish arch CNCCs reveals complex regulation by Edn1 and points to novel candidates for craniofacial disorders.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The discussion will be done in the context of specific examples. Among defense mechanisms, we explore how replicative limits and cellular senescence induced by telomere shortening can influence the emergence and evolution of tumors. Among treatment approaches, we consider the targeted treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We illustrate how basic evolutionary mathematical models have the potential to make patient-specific predictions about disease and treatment outcome, and argue that evolutionary models could become important clinical tools in the field of personalized medicine.},

Cells from ducts and lobules collected under the microscope were functionally characterized by colony formation on tissue culture plastic, mammosphere formation in suspension culture, and morphogenesis in laminin-rich extracellular matrix gels. Staining for the lineage markers keratins K14 and K19 further revealed multipotent cells in the stem cell zone and three lineage-restricted cell types outside this zone. Multiparameter cell sorting and functional characterization with reference to anatomical sites in situ confirmed this pattern.

	abstract = {Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are triggered by an aberrant hematopoietic stem cell (HSC). It is, however, unclear how this clone interferes with physiologic blood formation. In this study, we followed the hypothesis that the MDS clone impinges on feedback signals for self-renewal and differentiation and thereby suppresses normal hematopoiesis. Based on the theory that the MDS clone affects feedback signals for self-renewal and differentiation and hence suppresses normal hematopoiesis, we have developed a mathematical model to simulate different modifications in MDS-initiating cells and systemic feedback signals during disease development. These simulations revealed that the disease initiating cells must have higher self-renewal rates than normal HSCs to outcompete normal hematopoiesis. We assumed that self-renewal is the default pathway of stem and progenitor cells which is down-regulated by an increasing number of primitive cells in the bone marrow niche–including the premature MDS cells. Furthermore, the proliferative signal is up-regulated by cytopenia. Overall, our model is compatible with clinically observed MDS development, even though a single mutation scenario is unlikely for real disease progression which is usually associated with complex clonal hierarchy. For experimental validation of systemic feedback signals, we analyzed the impact of MDS patient derived serum on hematopoietic progenitor cells in vitro: in fact, MDS serum slightly increased proliferation, whereas maintenance of primitive phenotype was reduced. However, MDS serum did not significantly affect colony forming unit (CFU) frequencies indicating that regulation of self-renewal may involve local signals from the niche. Taken together, we suggest that initial mutations in MDS particularly favor aberrant high self-renewal rates. Accumulation of primitive MDS cells in the bone marrow then interferes with feedback signals for normal hematopoiesis–which then results in cytopenia.},

	abstract = {Recent studies of the population dynamics of a system of lymphocytes in an in vitro immune response have reported strong correlations in cell division times, both between parents and their progeny, and between those of sibling cells. The data also show a high level of correlation in the ultimate number of divisions achieved by cells within the same clone. Such correlations are often ignored in mathematical models of cell dynamics as they violate a standard assumption in the theory of branching processes, that of the statistical independence of cells. In this article we present a model in which these correlations can be incorporated, and have used this model to study the effect of these correlations on the population dynamics of a system of cells. We found that correlation in the division times between parents and their progeny can alter the mean population size of clones within the system, while all of the correlations can affect the variance in the sizes of different clones. The model was then applied to experimental data obtained from time-lapse video microscopy of a system of CpG stimulated B lymphocytes and it was found that inclusion of the correct correlation structure is necessary to accurately reproduce the observed population dynamics. We conclude that correlations in the dynamics of cells within an ensemble will affect the population dynamics of the system, and the effects will become more pronounced as the number of divisions increases.},

Here, we show that in addition to inducing dramatic phenotypic alterations, Snail attenuates the cell cycle and confers resistance to cell death induced by the withdrawal of survival factors and by pro-apoptotic signals. Hence, Snail favors changes in cell shape versus cell division, indicating that with respect to oncogenesis, although a deregulation/increase in proliferation is crucial for tumor formation and growth, this may not be so for tumor malignization. Finally, the resistance to cell death conferred by Snail provides a selective advantage to embryonic cells to migrate and colonize distant territories, and to malignant cells to separate from the primary tumor, invade, and form metastasis.},

In particular, when preparing microarray gene expression data from multiple cohorts, array platforms, or batches for later analyses, batch effects can have confounding effects, inducing spurious differences between study groups. Many methods and tools exist for removing batch effects from data. However, when study groups are not evenly distributed across batches, actual group differences may induce apparent batch differences, in which case batch adjustments may bias, usually deflate, group differences. Some tools therefore have the option of preserving the difference between study groups, e.g. using a two-way ANOVA model to simultaneously estimate both group and batch effects. Unfortunately, this approach may systematically induce incorrect group differences in downstream analyses when groups are distributed between the batches in an unbalanced manner. The scientific community seems to be largely unaware of how this approach may lead to false discoveries.},

Despite significant effort, successful clinical implementation of CRT inhibitory therapeutics remains a challenging goal. This is, in part, because of the challenge of identifying inhibitory compounds that specifically modulate the nuclear transcriptional activity of $\beta$-catenin while not affecting its cytoskeletal function in stabilizing adherens junctions at the cell membrane. Here, we report an RNAi-based modifier screening strategy for the identification of CRT inhibitors. Our data provide support for the specificity of these inhibitory compounds in antagonizing the transcriptional function of nuclear $\beta$-catenin. We show that these inhibitors efficiently block Wnt/$\beta$-catenin-induced target genes and phenotypes in various mammalian and cancer cell lines. Importantly, these Wnt inhibitors are specifically cytotoxic to human colon tumor biopsy cultures as well as colon cancer cell lines that exhibit deregulated Wnt signaling.},

While several mathematical models have been proposed to investigate the interaction between the transcription factors in recent years, there is still debate about the nature of the progenitor state in the dynamical system, and whether the existing models adequately capture new knowledge about the interactions gleaned from experimental data. Further, the models utilise different formalisms to represent the genetic regulation, and it appears that the resulting dynamical system depends upon which formalism is adopted.

This is the first method to compute Fisher information for stochastic chemical kinetics models without the need for Monte Carlo simulations. This methodology is then used to study sensitivity, robustness, and parameter identifiability in stochastic chemical kinetics models. We show that significant differences exist between stochastic and deterministic models as well as between stochastic models with time-series and time-point measurements. We demonstrate that these discrepancies arise from the variability in molecule numbers, correlations between species, and temporal correlations and show how this approach can be used in the analysis and design of experiments probing stochastic processes at the cellular level.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Single-cell data are now being collected in large quantities across multiple samples and gene profiling runs. This introduces the need for computational methods that can compare and stratify samples that are represented themselves as complex, high-dimensional objects. We introduce PhEMD as an analytical approach that can be used for this purpose. PhEMD uses Earth Mover9s Distance (EMD), a distance between probability distributions that is sensitive to differences at multiple levels of granularity, in order to compute an accurate measure of dissimilarity between single-cell samples. PhEMD then generates a low-dimensional embedding of the samples based on this dissimilarity. We demonstrate the utility of the PhEMD sample embedding by using it to subtype melanoma and clear-cell renal cell carcinomas based on their immune cell profiles. These analyses reveal sources of inter-sample heterogeneity that have potentially clinically actionable implications, given the recent adoption of immunotherapy as an effective treatment for these cancers. We also apply PhEMD to a newly-generated 300-sample CyTOF drug screen experiment, where the effects of 233 kinase inhibitors are measured at the single-cell resolution in 33 protein dimensions. In doing so, we find that PhEMD reveals novel insights into the effects of small-molecule inhibitors on breast cancer cell subpopulations undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Finally, by leveraging the Nystrom extension method for diffusion maps, we demonstrate that the results of PhEMD can be integrated with other data sources and data types to predict the single-cell phenotypes of samples not directly profiled. Our analyses demonstrate that PhEMD is highly scalable and compatible with leading batch effect correction techniques, allowing for the simultaneous comparison of many single-cell samples.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Together with glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), soluble factors present in a metanephric mesenchyme (MM) cell conditioned medium (BSN-CM) are necessary to induce branching morphogenesis of the isolated ureteric bud (UB) in vitro (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 96 (1999) 7330). Several lines of evidence are presented here in support of a modulating role for fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) in this process. RT-PCR revealed the expression of two FGF receptors, FGFR1(IIIc) and FGFR2(IIIb), in isolated embryonic day 13 rat UBs, which by indirect immunofluorescence displayed a uniform distribution. Rat kidney organ culture experiments in the presence of a soluble FGFR2(IIIb) chimera or a neutralizing antibody to FGF7 suggested an important contribution of FGFs other than FGF7 to the branching program. Several FGFs, including FGF1, FGF2, FGF7 and FGF10, in combination with GDNF and BSN-CM were found to affect growth and branching of the isolated UB, albeit with very different effects. FGF1 and FGF7 were at extreme ends of the spectrum, with FGF10 (more FGF1-like) and FGF2 (more FGF7-like) falling in between. FGF1 induced the formation of elongated UB branching stalks with distinct proliferative ampullary tips, whereas FGF7 induced amorphous buds displaying nonselective proliferation with little distinction between stalks and ampullae. Electron microscopic examination demonstrated that FGF1 treatment induced cytoskeletal organization, intercellular junctions and lumens along the stalk portion of the developing tubules, while the ampullary regions contained 'less differentiated' cells with an abundant secretory apparatus. In contrast, FGF7-induced UBs displayed this 'less differentiated' morphology regardless of position on the structure and were virtually indistinguishable from FGF1-induced ampullae. Consistent with this, GeneChip array analysis (employing a novel nanogram-scale assay consisting of two rounds of amplification and in vitro transcription for analyzing small quantities of RNA) revealed that FGF7-induced UBs expressed more markers of cell proliferation than FGF1, which caused the UB to express cytoskeletal proteins, extracellular matrix proteins, and at least one integrin, some of which may be important in UB branch elongation. Thus, while the various FGFs examined all support UB growth, FGF1 and FGF10 appear to be more important for branching and branch elongation, and may thus play a role in determination of nephron number and patterning in the developing kidney. These in vitro data may help to explain results from knockout and transgenic studies and suggest how different FGFs may, together with GDNF and other factor(s) secreted by MM cells, regulate branching morphogenesis of the UB by their relative effects on its growth, branching and branch elongation and differentiation, thereby affecting patterning in the developing kidney.},

	abstract = {The cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis states that only a small fraction of a malignant cell population is responsible for tumor growth and relapse. Understanding the relationships between CSC dynamics and cancer progression may contribute to improvements in cancer treatment. Analysis of a simple discrete mathematical model has suggested that homeostasis in developing tissues is governed by a "quorum sensing" control mechanism, in which stem cells differentiate or proliferate according to feedback they receive from neighboring cell populations. Further analysis of the same model has indicated that excessive stem cell proliferation leading to malignant transformation mainly results from altered sensitivity to such micro-environmental signals. Our aim in this work is to expand the analysis to the dynamics of established populations of cancer cells and to examine possible therapeutic avenues for eliminating CSCs. The proposed model considers two populations of cells: CSCs, which can divide indefinitely, and differentiated cancer cells, which do not divide and have a limited lifespan. We assume that total cell density has negative feedback on CSC proliferation and that high CSC density activates CSC differentiation. We show that neither stimulation of CSC differentiation nor inhibition of CSC proliferation alone is sufficient for complete CSC elimination and cancer cure, since each of these two therapies affects a different subpopulation of CSCs. However, a combination of these two strategies can substantially reduce the population sizes and densities of all types of cancer cells. Therefore, we propose that in clinical trials, CSC differentiation therapy should only be examined in combination with chemotherapy. Our conclusions are corroborated by clinical experience with differentiating agents in acute promyelocytic leukemia and neuroblastoma.},

It is unclear whether stem cells have the intrinsic capacity to control their responsiveness to environmental signals that can be fluctuating and noisy. Using a novel single-cell microRNA activity reporter, we show that miR-142 is bimodally expressed in embryonic stem cells, creating two states indistinguishable by pluripotency markers. A combination of modeling and quantitative experimental data revealed that mESCs switch stochastically between the two miR-142 states. We find that cells with high miR-142 expression are irresponsive to differentiation signals while cells with low miR-142 expression can respond to differentiation cues. We elucidate the molecular mechanism underpinning the bimodal regulation of miR-142 as a double-negative feedback loop between miR-142 and KRAS/ERK signaling and derive a quantitative description of this bistable system. miR-142 switches the activation status of key intracellular signaling pathways thereby locking cells in an undifferentiated state. This reveals a novel mechanism to maintain a stem cell reservoir buffered against fluctuating signaling environments.},

	abstract = {Since all-or-none decisions of the cell are controlled by extracellular signals, cells have biochemical switches within their intracellular signaling networks. Central elements of these switches are multisite phosphorylation, enzymic saturation, and amplification by cascades. Moreover, positive feedback can contribute to switch-like behavior termed also ultrasensitivity. Here we analyse the robustness of these mechanisms exemplified by models of the three-molecule MAPK-cascade and the single-molecule Goldbeter-Koshland switch. We show that the ultrasensitivity in the MAPK-cascades is more robust against changes of the kinetic parameters than the Goldbeter-Koshland switch. If multiple parameters are changed randomly, the effects of parameter changes can compensate each other in the cascade leading to a remarkable robustness of the switch-like behavior. The different degrees of robustness can be traced back to the different mechanisms of generating ultrasensitivity. While in the Goldbeter-Koshland switch the saturation of the enzymes are crucial, in the MAPK-cascade the adjustment of working ranges determines the ultrasensitivity. Our results indicate that amplification of ultrasensitivity in cascades and multisite phosphorylation might be a design principle to achieve robust switches.},

Standard ΔΔ\textit{G}° values (∼0.3 kcal/mol) calculated from melting temperature measurements comparing matched vs. mismatched base pairs at duplex DNA termini are far too low to explain pol accuracy.

	abstract = {MOTIVATION:The development of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) algorithms for parameter inference which are both computationally efficient and scalable in parallel computing environments is an important area of research. Monte Carlo rejection sampling, a fundamental component of ABC algorithms, is trivial to distribute over multiple processors but is inherently inefficient. The development of algorithms such as ABC Sequential Monte Carlo (ABC-SMC) helps address the inherent inefficiencies of rejection sampling, but such approaches are not as easily scaled on multiple processors. As a result, current Bayesian inference software offerings that use ABC-SMC lack the ability to scale in parallel computing environments. RESULTS:We present al3c, a C++ framework for implementing ABC-SMC in parallel. By requiring only that users define essential functions such as the simulation model and prior distribution function, al3c abstracts the user from both the complexities of parallel programming and the details of the ABC-SMC algorithm. By using the al3c framework, the user is able to scale the ABC-SMC algorithm in parallel computing environments for the specific application, with minimal programming overhead. AVAILABILITY:al3c is offered as a static binary for Linux and OS-X computing environments. The user completes an XML configuration file and C++ plug-in template for the specific application, which are used by al3c to obtain the desired results.

	abstract = {Author Summary Stem cells have long been associated with their ability to divide asymmetrically, when one daughter cell retains stem cell properties of the parent cell, while the other daughter cell becomes more mature and loses its stemness. Recent findings, however, point at the existence of an alternative, symmetric division strategy for stem cells in mammalian tissues. Here we ask the question: what engineering design principles might be responsible for optimization of stem cell division strategies? Although simple intuition may suggest that asymmetric divisions are better suited for stable maintenance of cell population numbers, our analysis shows that asymmetric divisions can also destabilize the system, depending on the particular “wiring” of the control loops that govern cellular fate decision making. We apply our theory to one particular unresolved question in mouse epidermis studies—why symmetric division percentage in paw epidermis is twice as high as that in ear and tail? The answer may be related to the fact that paw epidermis lacks hair follicles (a source of stem cells available in other types of skin), and it is also more injury-prone: symmetric divisions help stabilize skin in face of physical stresses from running, digging, grooming, and fighting—things that mice do with their paws. Thus, our theory offers quantitative explanations for the observed designs in stem cell lineages.},

Here we take advantage of the translucency of zebrafish larvae to observe the host innate immune cell response as oncogene-transformed melanoblasts and goblet cells multiply within the larval skin. Our studies indicate activation of leukocytes at very early stages in larvae carrying a transformed cell burden. Locally, we see recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages by 48 h post-fertilization, when transformed cells are still only singletons or doublets, and soon after this we see intimate associations between immune and transformed cells and frequent examples of cytoplasmic tethers linking the two cell types, as well as engulfment of transformed cells by both neutrophils and macrophages. We show that a major component of the signal drawing inflammatory cells to oncogenic HRAS(G12V)-transformed cells is H(2)O(2), which is also a key damage cue responsible for recruiting neutrophils to a wound. Our short-term blocking experiments show that preventing recruitment of immune cells at these early stages results in reduced growth of transformed cell clones and suggests that immune cells may provide a source of trophic support to the transformed cells just as they do at a site of tissue repair. These parallels between the inflammatory responses to transformed cells and to wounds reinforce the suggestion by others that cancers resemble non-healing wounds.},

	abstract = {Motivation:The analysis of RNA-Seq data from individual differentiating cells enables us to reconstruct the differentiation process and the degree of differentiation (in pseudo-time) of each cell. Such analyses can reveal detailed expression dynamics and functional relationships for differentiation. To further elucidate differentiation processes, more insight into gene regulatory networks is required. The pseudo-time can be regarded as time information and, therefore, single-cell RNA-Seq data are time-course data with high time resolution. Although time-course data are useful for inferring networks, conventional inference algorithms for such data suffer from high time complexity when the number of samples and genes is large. Therefore, a novel algorithm is necessary to infer networks from single-cell RNA-Seq during differentiation. Results:In this study, we developed the novel and efficient algorithm SCODE to infer regulatory networks, based on ordinary differential equations. We applied SCODE to three single-cell RNA-Seq datasets and confirmed that SCODE can reconstruct observed expression dynamics. We evaluated SCODE by comparing its inferred networks with use of a DNaseI-footprint based network. The performance of SCODE was best for two of the datasets and nearly best for the remaining dataset. We also compared the runtimes and showed that the runtimes for SCODE are significantly shorter than for alternatives. Thus, our algorithm provides a promising approach for further single-cell differentiation analyses. Availability:The R source code of SCODE is available at https://github.com/hmatsu1226/SCODE .

For example, if an early embryo is cut in half, it produces 2 perfectly patterned, smaller embryos. Where does the information guiding this development come from? Here, we explore this issue and ask whether a model composed of a simple set of rules governing cell behavior and cell—cell interactions produces in silico embryos. This agent-based computational model demonstrates that 4 rules, in which a cell makes decisions based on its neighbors to adopt polarity, make lineage choices, alter its adhesion, or die, can recapitulate blastocyst development in silico. By manipulating these rules, we could also recapitulate specific phenotypes at similar frequencies to those observed in vivo. One interesting prediction of our model is that the duration of cell—cell communication through fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling controls scaling of a region of the blastocyst, and we confirmed this experimentally. Taken together, our model specifies a set of rules that provide a framework for self-organization, and it is this self-organizing embryogenesis that may be an enabler of stochastic variation in evolution.},

It is well known that c-Met hyperactivation increases tumorigenicity and tumor cell resistance to DNA damaging agents, properties associated with tumor-initiating stem cells. However, a link between c-Met signaling and the formation and/or maintenance of neoplastic stem cells has not been previously identified. Here, we show that c-Met is activated and functional in glioblastoma (GBM) neurospheres enriched for glioblastoma tumor-initiating stem cells and that c-Met expression/function correlates with stem cell marker expression and the neoplastic stem cell phenotype in glioblastoma neurospheres and clinical glioblastoma specimens. c-Met activation was found to induce the expression of reprogramming transcription factors (RFs) known to support embryonic stem cells and induce differentiated cells to form pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, and c-Met activation counteracted the effects of forced differentiation in glioblastoma neurospheres. Expression of the reprogramming transcription factor Nanog by glioblastoma cells is shown to mediate the ability of c-Met to induce the stem cell characteristics of neurosphere formation and neurosphere cell self-renewal. These findings show that c-Met enhances the population of glioblastoma stem cells (GBM SCs) via a mechanism requiring Nanog and potentially other c-Met-responsive reprogramming transcription factors.},

Smoothers of overlapping Schwarz type are discussed; smoothing is restricted to the interior of the subdomains refined to the current level; thus it has optimal computational complexity. When applied to conforming finite element discretizations of elliptic problems and Maxwell equations, the method's convergence rates are very close to those for the nonadaptive version. Furthermore, the smoothers remain efficient for high order finite elements. We discuss the implementation in a general finite element code using the example of the deal.II library.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Early detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains elusive. Cystic precursor lesions of PDAC, specifically, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) represent a bona fide pathway to invasive neoplasia, although the molecular correlates of progression remain to be fully elucidated. Single cell transcriptomics provides a unique avenue for dissecting both the epithelial and microenvironmental heterogeneity that accompany multistep progression from non-invasive IPMNs to PDAC. Methods: Single cell RNA sequencing was performed through droplet-based sequencing on 5,403 cells derived from two low grade IPMNs (LGD-IPMN), two high grade IPMNs (HGD-IPMN), and two PDACs (all surgically resected). Results: Analysis of single cell transcriptomes revealed heterogeneous alterations within both the epithelium and in the tumor microenvironment during the progression of non-invasive dysplasia to invasive cancer. Specifically, while HGD-IPMNs expressed many core-signaling pathways described in PDAC, even LGD-IPMNs harbored subsets of single cells with a transcriptomic profile that overlapped with invasive cancer. Notably, a pro-inflammatory immune component was readily seen in low-grade IPMNs, comprised of cytotoxic T cells, activated T helper cells, and dendritic cells, which was progressively depleted during neoplastic progression, accompanied by infiltration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Finally, stromal myofibroblast populations were heterogeneous, and acquired a previously described tumor-promoting and immune-evading phenotype during invasive carcinogenesis. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the ability to perform high resolution profiling of the transcriptomic changes that occur during the multistep progression of cystic PDAC precursors to cancer. Notably, single cell analysis provides an unparalleled insight into both the epithelial and microenvironmental heterogeneity that accompany early cancer pathogenesis, and might be a useful substrate to identify targets for cancer interception.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

For example, the cytokine IL-2 can promote proliferation and death of T cells. The role of such paradoxical signaling remains unclear. To address this, we studied CD4(+) T cell expansion in culture. We found that cells with a 30-fold difference in initial concentrations reached a homeostatic concentration nearly independent of initial cell levels. Below an initial threshold, cell density decayed to extinction (OFF-state). We show that these dynamics relate to the paradoxical effect of IL-2, which increases the proliferation rate cooperatively and the death rate linearly. Mathematical modeling explained the observed cell and cytokine dynamics and predicted conditions that shifted cell fate from homeostasis to the OFF-state. We suggest that paradoxical signaling provides cell circuits with specific dynamical features that are robust to environmental perturbations.},

	abstract = {Cell size fundamentally affects all biosynthetic processes by determining the scale of organelles and influencing surface transport. Although extensive studies have identified many mutations affecting cell size, the molecular mechanisms underlying size control have remained elusive. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, size control occurs in G1 phase before Start, the point of irreversible commitment to cell division. It was previously thought that activity of the G1 cyclin Cln3 increased with cell size to trigger Start by initiating the inhibition of the transcriptional inhibitor Whi5 (refs 6, 7, 8). Here we show that although Cln3 concentration does modulate the rate at which cells pass Start, its synthesis increases in proportion to cell size so that its total concentration is nearly constant during pre-Start G1. Rather than increasing Cln3 activity, we identify decreasing Whi5 activity-due to the dilution of Whi5 by cell growth-as a molecular mechanism through which cell size controls proliferation. Whi5 is synthesized in S/G2/M phases of the cell cycle in a largely size-independent manner. This results in smaller daughter cells being born with higher Whi5 concentrations that extend their pre-Start G1 phase. Thus, at its most fundamental level, size control in budding yeast results from the differential scaling of Cln3 and Whi5 synthesis rates with cell size. More generally, our work shows that differential size-dependency of protein synthesis can provide an elegant mechanism to coordinate cellular functions with growth.},

The population frequencies of these three blood disorders fit well with a hierarchical model of hematopoiesis. The fate of any mutant clone will depend on the target cell and on the fitness advantage, if any, that the mutation confers on the cell.

We will argue that the difference between inference and design is that in the former we try to reconstruct the system that has given rise to the data that we observe, whereas in the latter, we seek to construct the system that produces the data that we would like to observe, i.e., the desired behavior. Our approach allows us to exploit methods from Bayesian statistics, including efficient exploration of models spaces and high-dimensional parameter spaces, and the ability to rank models with respect to their ability to generate certain types of data. Bayesian model selection furthermore automatically strikes a balance between complexity and (predictive or explanatory) performance of mathematical models. To deal with the complexities of molecular systems we employ an approximate Bayesian computation scheme which only requires us to simulate from different competing models to arrive at rational criteria for choosing between them. We illustrate the advantages resulting from combining the design and modeling (or in silico prototyping) stages currently seen as separate in synthetic biology by reference to deterministic and stochastic model systems exhibiting adaptive and switch-like behavior, as well as bacterial two-component signaling systems.},

This strategy consists of a surge of symmetric stem cell divisions, establishing the entire stem cell pool first, followed by a sharp transition to strictly asymmetric stem cell divisions, producing nonstem cells with a delay. We validate these predictions using lineage tracing and single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization of intestinal crypts in infant mice, uncovering small crypts that are entirely composed of Lgr5-labeled stem cells, which become a minority as crypts continue to grow.

The classical model of haematopoiesis postulates that, in the first step of differentiation, the stem cell generates common myelo-erythroid progenitors and common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs). However, our previous studies in fetal mice showed that myeloid potential persists even as the lineage branches segregate towards T and B cells. We therefore proposed the 'myeloid-based' model of haematopoiesis, in which the stem cell initially generates common myelo-erythroid progenitors and common myelo-lymphoid progenitors. T-cell and B-cell progenitors subsequently arise from common myelo-lymphoid progenitors through myeloid-T and myeloid-B stages, respectively. However, it has been unclear whether this myeloid-based model is also valid for adult haematopoiesis. Here we provide clonal evidence that the early cell populations in the adult thymus contain progenitors that have lost the potential to generate B cells but retain substantial macrophage potential as well as T-cell, natural killer (NK)-cell and dendritic-cell potential. We also show that such T-cell progenitors can give rise to macrophages in the thymic environment in vivo. Our findings argue against the classical dichotomy model in which T cells are derived from CLPs; instead, they support the validity of the myeloid-based model for both adult and fetal haematopoiesis.},

	abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are characterized by their ability of self-renewal to replenish the stem cell pool and differentiation to more mature cells. The subsequent stages of progenitor cells also share some of this dual ability. It is yet unknown whether external signals modulate proliferation rate or rather the fraction of self-renewal. We propose three multicompartment models, which rely on a single external feedback mechanism. In Model 1 the signal enhances proliferation, whereas the self-renewal rates in all compartments are fixed. In Model 2 the signal regulates the rate of self-renewal, whereas the proliferation rate is unchanged. In Model 3, the signal regulates both proliferation and self-renewal rates. This study demonstrates that a unique strictly positive stable steady state can only be achieved by regulation of the rate of self-renewal. Furthermore, it requires a lower number of effective cell doublings. In order to maintain the stem cell pool, the self-renewal ratio of the HSC has to be {\textgreater} or =50\% and it has to be higher than the self-renewal ratios of all downstream compartments. Interestingly, the equilibrium level of mature cells depends only on the parameters of self-renewal of HSC and it is independent of the parameters of dynamics of all upstream compartments. The model is compatible with the increase of leukocyte numbers following HSC transplantation. This study demonstrates that extrinsic regulation of the self-renewal rate of HSC is most essential in the process of hematopoiesis.},

	abstract = {Seeing a snapshot of individuals at different stages of a dynamic process can reveal what the process would look like for a single individual over time. Biologists apply this principle to infer temporal sequences of gene expression states in cells from measurements made at a single moment in time. However, the sparsity and high dimensionality of single-cell data have made inference difficult using formal approaches. Here, we apply recent innovations in spectral graph theory to devise a simple and asymptotically exact algorithm for inferring the unique dynamic solution under defined approximations and apply it to data from bone marrow stem cells. Single-cell expression profiling reveals the molecular states of individual cells with unprecedented detail. Because these methods destroy cells in the process of analysis, they cannot measure how gene expression changes over time. However, some information on dynamics is present in the data: the continuum of molecular states in the population can reflect the trajectory of a typical cell. Many methods for extracting single-cell dynamics from population data have been proposed. However, all such attempts face a common limitation: for any measured distribution of cell states, there are multiple dynamics that could give rise to it, and by extension, multiple possibilities for underlying mechanisms of gene regulation. Here, we describe the aspects of gene expression dynamics that cannot be inferred from a static snapshot alone and identify assumptions necessary to constrain a unique solution for cell dynamics from static snapshots. We translate these constraints into a practical algorithmic approach, population balance analysis (PBA), which makes use of a method from spectral graph theory to solve a class of high-dimensional differential equations. We use simulations to show the strengths and limitations of PBA, and then apply it to single-cell profiles of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). Cell state predictions from this analysis agree with HPC fate assays reported in several papers over the past two decades. By highlighting the fundamental limits on dynamic inference faced by any method, our framework provides a rigorous basis for dynamic interpretation of a gene expression continuum and clarifies best experimental designs for trajectory reconstruction from static snapshot measurements.},

However, the in vitro erythropoiesis, which produces red blood cells in cultures, has received much less attention from the modelling community. In this paper, we propose the first mathematical model of in vitro erythropoiesis. We start by formulating different models and select the best one at fitting experimental data of in vitro erythropoietic differentiation. It is based on a set of linear ODE, describing 3 hypothetical populations of cells at different stages of differentiation. We then compute confidence intervals for all of its parameters estimates, and conclude that our model is fully identifiable. Finally, we use this model to compute the effect of a chemical drug called Rapamycin, which affects all states of differentiation in the culture, and relate these effects to specific parameter variations. We provide the first model for the kinetics of in vitro cellular differentiation which is proven to be identifiable. It will serve as a basis for a model which will better account for the variability which is inherent to the experimental protocol used for the model calibration.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) continuously replenish the blood and immune systems. Their activity must be sustained throughout life to support optimal immune responses. It has been thought that stem cells may be somewhat protected from age because of their perpetual requirement to replenish the blood, however studies over the past 10 years have revealed dramatic changes in HSC function and phenotype with respect to age. When the number of HSC within murine bone marrow is measured, an increase in concentration and absolute number of HSC within the bone marrow is observed as the animal ages, paralleled with increased homogeneity of stem cell marker expression. Results from transplantation studies demonstrate that although there is a decline in hematopoietic output on a per-cell basis, the increase in number provides sufficient, yet abnormal, blood production throughout the lifespan of the animal. HSC may play a role in immunosenescence through cell-fate decisions leading to an overproduction of myeloid cells and an underproduction of lymphocytes. When examining gene expression of aged HSC, recent studies have highlighted several key factors contributing to increased inflammation, stress response and genomic instability. Here, we will review the general phenotype observed with aging of the hematopoietic system, focusing on the HSC, and compile recent expression profiling efforts that have examined HSC aging.},

Here, we bypass these limitations by using the FUCCI reporter system in human pluripotent stem cells and show that their capacity of differentiation varies during the progression of their cell cycle. These mechanisms are governed by the cell-cycle regulators cyclin D1-3 that control differentiation signals such as the TGF-$\beta$-Smad2/3 pathway. Conversely, cell-cycle manipulation using a small molecule directs differentiation of hPSCs and provides an approach to generate cell types with a clinical interest. Our results demonstrate that cell fate decisions are tightly associated with the cell-cycle machinery and reveal insights in the mechanisms synchronizing differentiation and proliferation in developing tissues.},

The fate behaviour of these cells is reflected in the time evolution of their progeny, termed clones, which serve as a key experimental observable. In adult tissues, where cell dynamics is constrained by the condition of homeostasis, clonal tracing studies based on transgenic animal models have advanced our understanding of cell fate behaviour and its dysregulation in disease1,2. But what can be learnt from clonal dynamics in development, where the spatial cohesiveness of clones is impaired by tissue deformations during tissue growth? Drawing on the results of clonal tracing studies, we show that, despite the complexity of organ development, clonal dynamics may converge to a critical state characterized by universal scaling behaviour of clone sizes. By mapping clonal dynamics onto a generalization of the classical theory of aerosols, we elucidate the origin and range of scaling behaviours and show how the identification of universal scaling dependences may allow lineage-specific information to be distilled from experiments. Our study shows the emergence of core concepts of statistical physics in an unexpected context, identifying cellular systems as a laboratory to study non-equilibrium statistical physics.},

Our data reveal heterogeneity in the regulatory landscape prior to gastrulation that reflects anatomical position, a feature that aligns with future cell fate. During mid embryogenesis, tissue granularity emerges such that cell types can be inferred by their chromatin accessibility, while maintaining a signature of their germ layer of origin. We identify over 30,000 distal elements with tissue-specific accessibility. Using transgenic embryos, we tested the germ layer specificity of a subset of predicted enhancers, achieving near-perfect accuracy. Overall, these data demonstrate the power of shotgun single cell profiling of embryos to resolve dynamic changes in open chromatin during development, and to uncover the cis-regulatory programs of germ layers and cell types.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In this way, first we show that higher variability in link strengths stabilizes food webs only when webs are relatively small, whereas larger webs are instead destabilized. Second, we reveal a new power law describing how food-web stability scales with the number of species and their connectance. Third, we report two universal rules: Food-web stability is enhanced when (i) species at a high trophic level feed on multiple prey species and (ii) species at an intermediate trophic level are fed upon by multiple predator species.},

Conversely, TLR3-deficient animals fail to initiate WIHN. TLR3 activation promotes expression of hair follicle stem cell markers and induces elements of the core hair morphogenetic program, including ectodysplasin A receptor (EDAR) and the Wnt and Shh pathways.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Using single-cell -omics data, it is now possible to computationally order cells along trajectories, allowing the unbiased study of cellular dynamic processes. Since 2014, more than 50 trajectory inference methods have been developed, each with its own set of methodological characteristics. As a result, choosing a method to infer trajectories is often challenging, since a comprehensive assessment of the performance and robustness of each method is still lacking. In order to facilitate the comparison of the results of these methods to each other and to a gold standard, we developed a global framework to benchmark trajectory inference tools. Using this framework, we compared the trajectories from a total of 29 trajectory inference methods, on a large collection of real and synthetic datasets. We evaluate methods using several metrics, including accuracy of the inferred ordering, correctness of the network topology, code quality and user friendliness. We found that some methods, including Slingshot, TSCAN and Monocle DDRTree, clearly outperform other methods, although their performance depended on the type of trajectory present in the data. Based on our benchmarking results, we therefore developed a set of guidelines for method users. However, our analysis also indicated that there is still a lot of room for improvement, especially for methods detecting complex trajectory topologies. Our evaluation pipeline can therefore be used to spearhead the development of new scalable and more accurate methods, and is available at github.com/dynverse/dynverse. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive assessment of trajectory inference methods. For now, we exclusively evaluated the methods on their default parameters, but plan to add a detailed parameter tuning procedure in the future. We gladly welcome any discussion and feedback on key decisions made as part of this study, including the metrics used in the benchmark, the quality control checklist, and the implementation of the method wrappers.

	abstract = {Among the most striking aspects of the movement of many animal groups are their sudden coherent changes in direction. Recent observations of locusts and starlings have shown that this directional switching is an intrinsic property of their motion. Similar direction switches are seen in self-propelled particle and other models of group motion. Comprehending the factors that determine such switches is key to understanding the movement of these groups. Here, we adopt a coarse-grained approach to the study of directional switching in a self-propelled particle model assuming an underlying one-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation for the mean velocity of the particles. We continue with this assumption in analyzing experimental data on locusts and use a similar systematic Fokker-Planck equation coefficient estimation approach to extract the relevant information for the assumed Fokker-Planck equation underlying that experimental data. In the experiment itself the motion of groups of 5 to 100 locust nymphs was investigated in a homogeneous laboratory environment, helping us to establish the intrinsic dynamics of locust marching bands. We determine the mean time between direction switches as a function of group density for the experimental data and the self-propelled particle model. This systematic approach allows us to identify key differences between the experimental data and the model, revealing that individual locusts appear to increase the randomness of their movements in response to a loss of alignment by the group. We give a quantitative description of how locusts use noise to maintain swarm alignment. We discuss further how properties of individual animal behavior, inferred by using the Fokker-Planck equation coefficient estimation approach, can be implemented in the self-propelled particle model to replicate qualitatively the group level dynamics seen in the experimental data.},

	abstract = {During development and evolution, the morphology of ectodermal organs can be modulated so that an organism can adapt to different environments. We have proposed that morphoregulation can be achieved by simply tilting the balance of molecular activity. We test the principles by analyzing the effects of partial downregulation of Bmp signaling in oral and dental epithelia of the keratin 14-Noggin transgenic mouse. We observed a wide spectrum of tooth phenotypes. The dental formula changed from 1.0.0.3/1.0.0.3 to 1.0.0.2(1)/1.0.0.0. All mandibular and M3 maxillary molars were selectively lost because of the developmental block at the early bud stage. First and second maxillary molars were reduced in size, exhibited altered crown patterns, and failed to form multiple roots. In these mice, incisors were not transformed into molars. Histogenesis and differentiation of ameloblasts and odontoblasts in molars and incisors were abnormal. Lack of enamel caused misocclusion of incisors, leading to deformation and enlargement in size. Therefore, subtle differences in the level, distribution, and timing of signaling molecules can have major morphoregulatory consequences. Modulation of Bmp signaling exemplifies morphoregulation hypothesis: simple alteration of key signaling pathways can be used to transform a prototypical conical-shaped tooth into one with complex morphology. The involvement of related pathways and the implication of morphoregulation in tooth evolution are discussed.},

PERK, a key upstream component, recognizes ER stress via its luminal sensor/transducer domain, but the molecular events that lead to UPR activation remain unclear. Here, we describe the crystal structures of mammalian PERK luminal domains captured in dimeric state as well as in a novel tetrameric state. Small angle X-ray scattering analysis (SAXS) supports the existence of both crystal structures also in solution. The salient feature of the tetramer interface, a helix swapped between dimers, implies transient association. Moreover, interface mutations that disrupt tetramer formation in vitro reduce phosphorylation of PERK and its target eIF2α in cells. These results suggest that transient conversion from dimeric to tetrameric state may be a key regulatory step in UPR activation. ![][1]{\textless}/img{\textgreater} Activation of unfolded protein response (UPR) upon ER stress involves key regulatory roles of ER-luminal sensor/transducer domains in UPR signaling factors.

Frameworks exist for understanding how stochastic fluctuations and transient differences in cell state contribute to experimentally observable variations in cellular responses. However, current methods do not allow identification of the sources of variability between and within stable subpopulations of cells. We present a data-driven modeling framework for the analysis of populations comprising heterogeneous subpopulations. Our approach combines mixture modeling with frameworks for distribution approximation, facilitating the integration of multiple single-cell datasets and the detection of causal differences between and within subpopulations. The computational efficiency of our framework allows hundreds of competing hypotheses to be compared. We initially validate our method using simulated data with an understood ground truth, then we analyze data collected using quantitative single-cell microscopy of cultured sensory neurons involved in pain initiation. This approach allows us to quantify the relative contribution of neuronal subpopulations, culture conditions, and expression levels of signaling proteins to the observed cell-to-cell variability in NGF/TrkA-initiated Erk1/2 signaling.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In particular, we propose a strategy for identifying the driver nodes that need to be controlled and design a general form of control functions for realizing such a transition.

A population might enhance its fitness by allowing individual cells to stochastically transition among multiple phenotypes, thus ensuring that some cells are always prepared for an unforeseen environmental fluctuation. Here we experimentally explore how switching affects population growth by using the galactose utilization network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We engineered a strain that randomly transitions between two phenotypes as a result of stochastic gene expression. Each phenotype was designed to confer a growth advantage over the other phenotype in a certain environment. When we compared the growth of two populations with different switching rates, we found that fast-switching populations outgrow slow switchers when the environment fluctuates rapidly, whereas slow-switching phenotypes outgrow fast switchers when the environment changes rarely. These results suggest that cells may tune inter-phenotype switching rates to the frequency of environmental changes.},

Here we present a theoretical framework for the unified neutral theory of biodiversity and an analytical solution for the distribution of the RSA both in the metacommunity (Fisher's log series) and in the local community, where there are fewer rare species. Rare species are more extinction-prone, and once they go locally extinct, they take longer to re-immigrate than do common species. Contrary to recent assertions, we show that the analytical solution provides a better fit, with fewer free parameters, to the RSA distribution of tree species on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, than the lognormal distribution.},

A kinetic analysis of mTOR inhibition revealed that the pathway regulates epithelial differentiation, which in turn controls the cytokine milieu of the colon. Consistent with our in vivo analysis, we found that cytokine expression of organoids grown ex vivo, in the absence of bacteria and immune cells, was dependent on differentiation state. Our study suggests that proper differentiation of epithelial cells is an important feature of colonic homeostasis because of its effect on the secretion of inflammatory cytokines.},

These Yanomami harbor a microbiome with the highest diversity of bacteria and genetic functions ever reported in a human group. Despite their isolation, presumably for {\textgreater}11,000 years since their ancestors arrived in South America, and no known exposure to antibiotics, they harbor bacteria that carry functional antibiotic resistance (AR) genes, including those that confer resistance to synthetic antibiotics and are syntenic with mobilization elements. These results suggest that westernization significantly affects human microbiome diversity and that functional AR genes appear to be a feature of the human microbiome even in the absence of exposure to commercial antibiotics. AR genes are likely poised for mobilization and enrichment upon exposure to pharmacological levels of antibiotics.

The condition is frequently observed in certain carcinomas (e.g., breast cancer), B-cell lymphoma, and melanoma, with relapse occurring 5-25 y later. Clinical data suggest that a majority of breast cancer survivors have cancer cells for decades but can remain clinically cancer-free for their lifetime. Thus, there is a major effort to characterize the molecular mechanisms responsible for inducing tumor cell dormancy using experimental models or studying the early phases of cancer growth in humans. Many molecules and signaling pathways have been characterized and have led to concepts that dominate the field, such as the possible role of innate and adaptive immunity in immune surveillance and initiation and maintenance of dormancy. However, recent clinical data do not support many of these concepts. Several areas need further study to determine their relevance to clinical cancer dormancy. We suggest hypotheses that may contribute to elucidation of the mechanisms underlying the dormant state.},

	abstract = {Nearly all cancers are linked by the inexorable phenotype of metastasis as malignant growths have the capability to spread from their place of origin to distant sites throughout the body. While different cancers may have various propensities to migrate towards specific locations, they are all linked by this unifying principal. Unlike most neoplasms, leukaemia has inherent cell motility as leukocytes are required to move throughout the vascular system, suggesting that no mutations are required for anchorage independent growth. As such, it seems likely that leukaemias are inherently metastatic, endowed with the deadliest phenotype of cancer simply due to cell of origin. This article presents the biology of metastasis development and how leukaemia cells are inherently provided these phenotypic characteristics. It is then proposed how clinicians may be able to exploit the motility of leukaemia and metastatic emboli of other cancer types through an approach known as sonodynamic therapy (SDT), a treatment modality that combines chemotherapeutic agents with ultrasound to preferentially damage malignant cells. As experimental evidence has indicated, SDT is a promising therapeutic approach in need of clinical testing for further validation.},

	doi = {10.7554/eLife.32303},
	abstract = {When viruses infect cells, they take over the cell’s machinery and use it to express their own genes. This process has mostly been studied by looking at the average outcome of infection when many viruses infect many cells. However, it is less clear what happens in individual cells. For example, does the virus take over every cell to make lots of viral gene products, or do some cells produce far more viral gene products than others? Russell et al. have now used a new technique called single-cell RNA sequencing to look at how well influenza virus genes were expressed in hundreds of individual mammalian cells. The goal was to work out how the outcome of infection varied between different cells. One way to quantify variability – also known as heterogeneity – is by using a statistical measure called the Gini coefficient. This statistic is often used to assess the inequality in incomes across a nation.In the hypothetical situation where everyone earned the same income, the Gini coefficient would equal zero; while if only one person had all the income and all others had none, the value would be very close to one. In reality, countries fall somewhere in between these two extremes. In the United States for instance, the Gini coefficient for income is 0.47. When Russell et al. worked out the Gini coefficient for the amount of viral genes expressed in different cells, the value was at least 0.64. This indicates that there is more unevenness in viral gene expression for influenza than there is income inequality in the United States. So, what characterizes the “Bill Gates” cells and viruses that have the highest viral gene expression? Influenza viruses sometimes fail to express some of their genes. Russell et al. found that this failure often led to “poor” viruses that were less productive than “rich” viruses that expressed all the critical genes. However, the results suggest that there are also other factors that contribute a lot to the heterogeneity. Real influenza virus infections are usually started by very few viruses, so this new understanding of the variability that occurs when individual viruses infect individual cells might prove important for understanding the properties of infections at larger scales too.},

	abstract = {The major bcr-abl fusion gene is presently seen as the hallmark of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and presumably as the cause of its development. Accordingly, long-term disappearance of bcr-abl after intensive therapy is considered to be a probable cure of CML. The nested reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) provides a powerful tool for minimal residual CML detection. The RT-PCR was optimized by (1) increasing the amount of total RNA involved in the reverse transcription reaction to correspond to total RNA extracted from 10(8) cells, (2) using a specific abl primer in this reverse reaction, and (3) reamplifying 10\% of the RT-PCR product in nested amplification. This optimized RT-PCR permitted us to detect up to 1 copy of RNA bcr-abl synthesised in vitro, mixed with yeast RNA in an equivalent quantity to 10(8) white blood cells (WBCs). Using this highly sensitive RT-PCR during the follow-up of CML patients, a signal was unexpectedly found in healthy controls. Therefore, a systematic study of the possible expression of bcr-abl RNA in the WBCs of healthy adults and children and in umbilical cord blood was undertaken. It showed the presence of bcr-abl transcript in the blood of 22 of 73 healthy adults and in the blood of 1 of 22 children but not in 22 samples of umbilical cord blood.},

	abstract = {Polarization of cell phenotypes, a common strategy to achieve cell type diversity in metazoa, results from binary cell-fate decisions in the branching pedigree of development. Such "either-or" fate decisions are controlled by two opposing cell fate-determining transcription factors. Each of the two distinct "master regulators" promotes differentiation of its respective sister lineage. But they also suppress one other, leading to their mutually exclusive expression in the two ensuing lineages. Thus, promiscuous coexistence of the antagonist regulators in the same cell, the hallmark of the common "undecided" progenitor of two sister lineages, is considered unstable. This antagonism ensures robust polarization into two discretely distinct cell types. But now the immune system's T-helper (Th) cells and their two canonical subtypes, Th1 and Th2 cells, tell a different story, as revealed in three papers recently published in PLOS Biology. The intermediate state that co-expresses the two opposing master regulators of the Th1 and Th2 subtypes, T-bet and Gata3, is highly stable and is not necessarily an undecided precursor. Instead, the Th1/Th2 hybrid cell is a robust new type with properties of both Th1 and Th2 cells. These hybrid cells are functionally active and possess the benefit of moderation: self-limitation of effector T cell function to prevent excessive inflammation, a permanent risk in host defense that can cause tissue damage or autoimmunity. Gene regulatory network analysis suggests that stabilization of the intermediate center in a polarizing system can be achieved by minor tweaking of the architecture of the mutual suppression gene circuit, and thus is a design option readily available to evolution.},

We tracked the cumulative divisional history of slow-cycling hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) throughout adult life. This revealed a fraction of rarely dividing HSCs that contained all the long-term HSC (LT-HSC) activity within the aging HSC compartment. During adult life, this population asynchronously completes four traceable symmetric self-renewal divisions to expand its size before entering a state of dormancy. We show that the mechanism of expansion involves progressively lengthening periods between cell divisions, with long-term regenerative potential lost upon a fifth division. Our data also show that age-related phenotypic changes within the HSC compartment are divisional history dependent. These results suggest that HSCs accumulate discrete memory stages over their divisional history and provide evidence for the role of cellular memory in HSC aging.},

This is an area where mathematical modelling can complement experimental approaches, and even simple mathematical models can yield useful biological insights. This review presents examples of this in the context of understanding the combined effects of different levels of cell death and cell division in a number of biological systems including tumour growth, the homeostasis of immune memory and pre-implantation embryo development. The models we describe, although simplistic, yield insight into several phenomena that are difficult to understand using a purely experimental approach. This includes the different roles played by the apoptosis of stem cells and differentiated cells in determining whether or not a tumour can grow; the way in which a density dependent rate of apoptosis (for instance mediated by cell-cell contact or cytokine signalling) can lead to homeostasis; and the effect of stochastic fluctuations when the number of cells involved is small. We also highlight how models can maximize the amount of information that can be extracted from limited experimental data. The review concludes by summarizing the various mathematical frameworks that can be used to develop new models and the type of biological information that is required to do this.},

	abstract = {Stochastic fluctuations in reaction–diffusion processes often have substantial effect on spatial and temporal dynamics of signal transductions in complex biological systems. One popular approach for simulating these processes is to divide the system into small spatial compartments assuming that molecules react only within the same compartment and jump between adjacent compartments driven by the diffusion. While the approach is convenient in terms of its implementation, its computational cost may become prohibitive when diffusive jumps occur significantly more frequently than reactions, as in the case of rapid diffusion. Here, we present a hybrid continuous-discrete method in which diffusion is simulated using continuous approximation while reactions are based on the Gillespie algorithm. Specifically, the diffusive jumps are approximated as continuous Gaussian random vectors with time-dependent means and covariances, allowing use of a large time step, even for rapid diffusion. By considering the correlation among diffusive jumps, the approximation is accurate for the second moment of the diffusion process. In addition, a criterion is obtained for identifying the region in which such diffusion approximation is required to enable adaptive calculations for better accuracy. Applications to a linear diffusion system and two nonlinear systems of morphogens demonstrate the effectiveness and benefits of the new hybrid method.},

Combining a conditional mouse model that closely resembles the slow evolution and the mosaic AE expression pattern of human t(8;21) CBF AML with global transcriptome sequencing, we find that disease progression was characterized by two principal pathogenic mechanisms. Initially, AE expression modified the lineage potential of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), resulting in the selective expansion of the myeloid compartment at the expense of normal erythro- and lymphopoiesis. This lineage skewing was followed by a second substantial rewiring of transcriptional networks occurring in the trajectory to manifest leukaemia. We also find that both HSC and lineage-restricted granulocyte macrophage progenitors (GMPs) acquired leukaemic stem cell (LSC) potential being capable of initiating and maintaining the disease. Finally, our data demonstrate that long-term expression of AE induces an indolent myeloproliferative disease (MPD)-like myeloid leukaemia phenotype with complete penetrance and that acute inactivation of AE function is a potential novel therapeutic option. →See accompanying article [10.1002/emmm.201303483][1] [1]: http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/emmm.201303483},

	abstract = {The characteristics of the host contact network over which a pathogen is transmitted affect both epidemic spread and the projected effectiveness of control strategies. Given the importance of understanding these contact networks, it is unfortunate that they are very difficult to measure directly. This challenge has led to an interest in methods to infer information about host contact networks from pathogen phylogenies, because in shaping a pathogen's opportunities for reproduction, contact networks also shape pathogen evolution. Host networks influence pathogen phylogenies both directly, through governing opportunities for evolution, and indirectly by changing the prevalence and incidence. Here, we aim to separate these two effects by comparing pathogen evolution on different host networks that share similar epidemic trajectories. This approach allows use to examine the direct effects of network structure on pathogen phylogenies, largely controlling for confounding differences arising from population dynamics. We find that networks with more heterogeneous degree distributions yield pathogen phylogenies with more variable cluster numbers, smaller mean cluster sizes, shorter mean branch lengths, and somewhat higher tree imbalance than networks with relatively homogeneous degree distributions. However, in particular for dynamic networks, we find that these direct effects are relatively modest. These findings suggest that the role of the epidemic trajectory, the dynamics of the network and the inherent variability of metrics such as cluster size must each be taken into account when trying to use pathogen phylogenies to understand characteristics about the underlying host contact network.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION:Exome sequencing technologies have transformed the field of Mendelian genetics and allowed for efficient detection of genomic variants in protein-coding regions. The target enrichment process that is intrinsic to exome sequencing is inherently imperfect, generating large amounts of unintended off-target sequence. Off-target data are characterized by very low and highly heterogeneous coverage and are usually discarded by exome analysis pipelines. We posit that off-target read depth is a rich, but overlooked, source of information that could be mined to detect intergenic copy number variation (CNV). We propose cnvOffseq, a novel normalization framework for off-target read depth that is based on local adaptive singular value decomposition (SVD). This method is designed to address the heterogeneity of the underlying data and allows for accurate and precise CNV detection and genotyping in off-target regions. RESULTS:cnvOffSeq was benchmarked on whole-exome sequencing samples from the 1000 Genomes Project. In a set of 104 gold standard intergenic deletions, our method achieved a sensitivity of 57.5\% and a specificity of 99.2\%, while maintaining a low FDR of 5\%. For gold standard deletions longer than 5 kb, cnvOffSeq achieves a sensitivity of 90.4\% without increasing the FDR. cnvOffSeq outperforms both whole-genome and whole-exome CNV detection methods considerably and is shown to offer a substantial improvement over naïve local SVD. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:cnvOffSeq is available at http://sourceforge.net/p/cnvoffseq/. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Three MTG genes, MTG8, MTG16 and MTGR1, are expressed in distinct patterns in the developing nervous system. Various bHLH proteins are also expressed in distinct patterns. We asked whether there is a functional relationship between specific MTG and bHLH proteins in developing chick spinal cord. First, we examined if each MTG gene is induced by specific bHLH proteins. Although expression of NEUROG2, ASCL1 and MTG genes overlapped, the boundaries of gene expression did not match. Ectopic expression analysis showed that MTGR1 and NEUROD4, which show similar expression patterns, are regulated differently by NEUROG2 and ASCL1. Thus, our results show that expression of MTG genes is not regulated by a single upstream bHLH protein, but represents an integration of the activity of multiple regulators. Next, we asked if each MTG protein inhibits specific bHLH proteins. Transcription assay showed that NEUROG2 and ASCL1 are inhibited by MTGR1 and MTG16, and less efficiently by MTG8. Deletion mapping of MTGR1 showed that MTGR1 binds NEUROG2 and ASCL1 using multiple interaction surfaces, and all conserved domains are required for its repressor activity. These results support the model that MTG proteins form a higher-order repressor complex and modulate transcriptional activity of bHLH proteins during neurogenesis.},

Fetal liver contained large numbers of distinct oligopotent progenitors with intermingled My, Er, and Mk fates. However, few oligopotent progenitor intermediates were present in the adult bone marrow. Instead, only two progenitor classes predominate, multipotent and unipotent, with Er-Mk lineages emerging from multipotent cells.

	abstract = {Mutual inhibitory positive feedback (MIPF), or double-negative feedback, is a key regulatory motif of cellular memory with the capability of maintaining switched states for transient stimuli. Such MIPFs are found in various biological systems where they are interlinked in many cases despite a single MIPF can still realize such a memory effect. An intriguing question then arises about the advantage of interlinking MIPFs instead of exploiting an isolated single MIPF to realize the memory effect. We have investigated the advantages of interlinked MIPF systems through mathematical modeling and computer simulations. Our results revealed that interlinking MIPFs expands the parameter range of achieving the memory effect, or the memory region, thereby making the system more robust to parameter perturbations. Moreover, the minimal duration and amplitude of an external stimulus required for off-to-on state transition are increased and, as a result, external noises can more effectively be filtered out. Hence, interlinked MIPF systems can realize more robust cellular memories with respect to both parameter perturbations and external noises. Our study suggests that interlinked MIPF systems might be an evolutionary consequence acquired for a more reliable memory effect by enhancing robustness against noisy cellular environments.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:There is variability in the cancer phenotype across individuals: two patients with the same tumour may experience different disease life histories, resulting from genetic variation within the tumour and from the interaction between tumour and host. Until now, phenotypic variability has precluded a clear-cut identification of the fundamental characteristics of a given tumour type. METHODS:Using multiple myeloma as an example, we apply the principles of evolutionary game theory to determine the fundamental characteristics that define the phenotypic variability of a tumour. RESULTS:Tumour dynamics is determined by the frequency-dependent fitness of different cell populations, resulting from the benefits and costs accrued by each cell type in the presence of others. Our study shows how the phenotypic variability in multiple myeloma bone disease can be understood through the theoretical approach of a game that allows the identification of key genotypic features in a tumour and provides a natural explanation for phenotypic variability. This analysis also illustrates how complex biochemical signals can be translated into cell fitness that determines disease dynamics. CONCLUSION:The present paradigm is general and extends well beyond multiple myeloma, and even to non-neoplastic disorders. Furthermore, it provides a new perspective in dealing with cancer eradication. Instead of trying to kill all cancer cells, therapies should aim at reducing the fitness of malignant cells compared with normal cells, allowing natural selection to eradicate the tumour.},

We discovered that somatic mutations accumulated during normal development of a higher organism implicitly encode its entire cell lineage tree with very high precision. Our mathematical analysis of known mutation rates in microsatellites (MSs) shows that the entire cell lineage tree of a human embryo, or a mouse, in which no cell is a descendent of more than 40 divisions, can be reconstructed from information on somatic MS mutations alone with no errors, with probability greater than 99.95\%. Analyzing all {\textbackslash}textasciitilde1.5 million MSs of each cell of an organism may not be practical at present, but we also show that in a genetically unstable organism, analyzing only a few hundred MSs may suffice to reconstruct portions of its cell lineage tree. We demonstrate the utility of the approach by reconstructing cell lineage trees from DNA samples of a human cell line displaying MS instability. Our discovery and its associated procedure, which we have automated, may point the way to a future “Human Cell Lineage Project” that would aim to resolve fundamental open questions in biology and medicine by reconstructing ever larger portions of the human cell lineage tree.},

Cells react to their microenvironment by modulating processes such as movement, growth and proliferation, and signalling.

To this end a variety of cell-based modelling approaches have been developed, ranging from lattice-based cellular automata to lattice-free models that treat cells as point-like particles or extended shapes. It is difficult to accurately compare between different modelling approaches, since one cannot distinguish between differences in behaviour due to the underlying model assumptions and those due to differences in the numerical implementation of the model. Here, we exploit the availability of an implementation of five popular cell-based modelling approaches within a consistent computational framework, Chaste (http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste). This framework allows one to easily change constitutive assumptions within these models. In each case we provide full details of all technical aspects of our model implementations. We compare model implementations using four case studies, chosen to reflect the key cellular processes of proliferation, adhesion, and short- and long-range signalling.

While the expression levels of multiple genes in each cell are available in such data, the potential connections among the cells (e.g. the lineage relationship) are not directly evident from the measurement. Classifying cellular states and identifying transitions among those states are challenging due to many factors, including the small number of cells versus the large number of genes collected in the data. In this paper we adapt a classical self-organizing-map approach to single-cell gene expression data, such as those based on qPCR and RNA-seq. In this method (SOMSC), a cellular state map (CSM) is derived and employed to identify cellular states inherited in a population of measured single cells. Cells located in the same basin of the CSM are considered as in one cellular state while barriers between the basins provide information on transitions among the cellular states. Consequently, paths of cellular state transitions (e.g. differentiation) and a temporal ordering of the measured single cells are obtained. Applied to a set of synthetic data, two single-cell qPCR data sets and two single-cell RNA-seq data sets for a simulated model of cell differentiation, and systems on the early embryo development, haematopoietic cell lineages, human preimplanation embryo development, and human skeletal muscle myoblasts differentiation, the SOMSC shows good capabilities in identifying cellular states and their transitions in the high-dimensional single-cell data. This approach will have broad applications in studying cell lineages and cellular fate specification.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

CN is effectively treated with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), which is known to interfere with apoptosis in neutrophil precursors and to consequently increase the circulating neutrophil level. However, G-CSF treatment usually fails to eliminate the oscillation. In this study, we establish an age-structured model of hematopoiesis, which reduces to a set of four delay differential equations with specific forms of initial functions. We numerically investigate the possible stable solutions of the model equations with respect to changes in the parameters as well as the initial conditions. The results show that the hematopoietic system possesses multistability for parameters typical of the normal healthy state. From our numerical results, decreasing the proliferation rate of neutrophil precursors or increasing the stem cell death rate are two possible mechanisms to induce cyclical neutropenia, and the periods of the resulting oscillations are independent of the changing parameters. We also discuss the dependence of the model solution on the initial condition at normal parameter values corresponding to a healthy state. Using insight from our results we design a hybrid treatment method that is able to abolish the oscillations in CN.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES:The luminal surface of the gut is lined with a monolayer of epithelial cells that acts as a nutrient absorptive engine and protective barrier. To maintain its integrity and functionality, the epithelium is renewed every few days. Theoretical models are powerful tools that can be used to test hypotheses concerning the regulation of this renewal process, to investigate how its dysfunction can lead to loss of homeostasis and neoplasia, and to identify potential therapeutic interventions. Here we propose a new multiscale model for crypt dynamics that links phenomena occurring at the subcellular, cellular and tissue levels of organisation. METHODS:At the subcellular level, deterministic models characterise molecular networks, such as cell-cycle control and Wnt signalling. The output of these models determines the behaviour of each epithelial cell in response to intra-, inter- and extracellular cues. The modular nature of the model enables us to easily modify individual assumptions and analyse their effects on the system as a whole. RESULTS:We perform virtual microdissection and labelling-index experiments, evaluate the impact of various model extensions, obtain new insight into clonal expansion in the crypt, and compare our predictions with recent mitochondrial DNA mutation data. CONCLUSIONS:We demonstrate that relaxing the assumption that stem-cell positions are fixed enables clonal expansion and niche succession to occur. We also predict that the presence of extracellular factors near the base of the crypt alone suffices to explain the observed spatial variation in nuclear beta-catenin levels along the crypt axis.},

	abstract = {The wide availability of user-provided content in online social media facilitates the aggregation of people around common interests, worldviews, and narratives. However, the World Wide Web (WWW) also allows for the rapid dissemination of unsubstantiated rumors and conspiracy theories that often elicit rapid, large, but naive social responses such as the recent case of Jade Helm 15–where a simple military exercise turned out to be perceived as the beginning of a new civil war in the United States. In this work, we address the determinants governing misinformation spreading through a thorough quantitative analysis. In particular, we focus on how Facebook users consume information related to two distinct narratives: scientific and conspiracy news. We find that, although consumers of scientific and conspiracy stories present similar consumption patterns with respect to content, cascade dynamics differ. Selective exposure to content is the primary driver of content diffusion and generates the formation of homogeneous clusters, i.e., "echo chambers." Indeed, homogeneity appears to be the primary driver for the diffusion of contents and each echo chamber has its own cascade dynamics. Finally, we introduce a data-driven percolation model mimicking rumor spreading and we show that homogeneity and polarization are the main determinants for predicting cascades' size.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Nitrogen regulation in Escherichia coli is a model system for gene regulation in bacteria. Growth on glutamine as a sole nitrogen source is assumed to be nitrogen limiting, inferred from slow growth and strong NtrB/NtrC-dependent gene activation. However, we show that under these conditions, the intracellular glutamine concentration is not limiting but 5.6-fold higher than in ammonium-replete conditions; in addition, α-ketoglutarate concentrations are elevated. We address this glutamine paradox from a systems perspective. We show that the dominant role of NtrC is to regulate glnA transcription and its own expression, indicating that the glutamine paradox is not due to NtrC-independent gene regulation. The absolute intracellular NtrC and GS concentrations reveal molecular control parameters, where NtrC-specific activities were highest in nitrogen-starved cells, while under glutamine growth, NtrC showed intermediate specific activity. We propose an in vivo model in which α-ketoglutarate can derepress nitrogen regulation despite nitrogen sufficiency. IMPORTANCE Nitrogen is the most important nutrient for cell growth after carbon, and its metabolism is coordinated at the metabolic, transcriptional, and protein levels. We show that growth on glutamine as a sole nitrogen source, commonly assumed to be nitrogen limiting and used as such as a model system for nitrogen limitation, is in fact nitrogen replete. Our integrative quantitative analysis of key molecules involved in nitrogen assimilation and regulation reveal that glutamine is not necessarily the dominant molecule signaling nitrogen sufficiency and that α-ketoglutarate may play a more important role in signaling nitrogen status. NtrB/NtrC integrates α-ketoglutarate and glutamine signaling-sensed by the UTase (glnD) and PII (glnB), respectively-and regulates the nitrogen response through self-regulated expression and phosphorylation-dependent activation of the nitrogen (ntr) regulon. Our findings support α-ketoglutarate acting as a global regulatory metabolite.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Thromboembolism, one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, is characterized by formation of obstructive intravascular clots (thrombi) and their mechanical breakage (embolization). A novel two-dimensional multi-phase computational model is introduced that describes active interactions between the main components of the clot, including platelets and fibrin, to study the impact of various physiologically relevant blood shear flow conditions on deformation and embolization of a partially obstructive clot with variable permeability. Simulations provide new insights into mechanisms underlying clot stability and embolization that cannot be studied experimentally at this time. In particular, model simulations, calibrated using experimental intravital imaging of an established arteriolar clot, show that flow-induced changes in size, shape and internal structure of the clot are largely determined by two shear-dependent mechanisms: reversible attachment of platelets to the exterior of the clot and removal of large clot pieces. Model simulations predict that blood clots with higher permeability are more prone to embolization with enhanced disintegration under increasing shear rate. In contrast, less permeable clots are more resistant to rupture due to shear rate-dependent clot stiffening originating from enhanced platelet adhesion and aggregation. These results can be used in future to predict risk of thromboembolism based on the data about composition, permeability and deformability of a clot under specific local haemodynamic conditions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Many organs of higher organisms, such as the vascular system, lung, kidney, pancreas, liver and glands, are heavily branched structures. The branching process during lung development has been studied in great detail and is remarkably stereotyped. The branched tree is generated by the sequential, non-random use of three geometrically simple modes of branching (domain branching, planar and orthogonal bifurcation). While many regulatory components and local interactions have been defined an integrated understanding of the regulatory network that controls the branching process is lacking. We have developed a deterministic, spatio-temporal differential-equation based model of the core signaling network that governs lung branching morphogenesis. The model focuses on the two key signaling factors that have been identified in experiments, fibroblast growth factor (FGF10) and sonic hedgehog (SHH) as well as the SHH receptor patched (Ptc). We show that the reported biochemical interactions give rise to a Schnakenberg-type Turing patterning mechanisms that allows us to reproduce experimental observations in wildtype and mutant mice. The kinetic parameters as well as the domain shape are based on experimental data where available. The developed model is robust to small absolute and large relative changes in the parameter values. At the same time there is a strong regulatory potential in that the switching between branching modes can be achieved by targeted changes in the parameter values. We note that the sequence of different branching events may also be the result of different growth speeds: fast growth triggers lateral branching while slow growth favours bifurcations in our model. We conclude that the FGF10-SHH-Ptc1 module is sufficient to generate pattern that correspond to the observed branching modes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Intratumor heterogeneity may foster tumor evolution and adaptation and hinder personalized-medicine strategies that depend on results from single tumor-biopsy samples. METHODS:To examine intratumor heterogeneity, we performed exome sequencing, chromosome aberration analysis, and ploidy profiling on multiple spatially separated samples obtained from primary renal carcinomas and associated metastatic sites. We characterized the consequences of intratumor heterogeneity using immunohistochemical analysis, mutation functional analysis, and profiling of messenger RNA expression. RESULTS:Phylogenetic reconstruction revealed branched evolutionary tumor growth, with 63 to 69\% of all somatic mutations not detectable across every tumor region. Intratumor heterogeneity was observed for a mutation within an autoinhibitory domain of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase, correlating with S6 and 4EBP phosphorylation in vivo and constitutive activation of mTOR kinase activity in vitro. Mutational intratumor heterogeneity was seen for multiple tumor-suppressor genes converging on loss of function; SETD2, PTEN, and KDM5C underwent multiple distinct and spatially separated inactivating mutations within a single tumor, suggesting convergent phenotypic evolution. Gene-expression signatures of good and poor prognosis were detected in different regions of the same tumor. Allelic composition and ploidy profiling analysis revealed extensive intratumor heterogeneity, with 26 of 30 tumor samples from four tumors harboring divergent allelic-imbalance profiles and with ploidy heterogeneity in two of four tumors. CONCLUSIONS:Intratumor heterogeneity can lead to underestimation of the tumor genomics landscape portrayed from single tumor-biopsy samples and may present major challenges to personalized-medicine and biomarker development. Intratumor heterogeneity, associated with heterogeneous protein function, may foster tumor adaptation and therapeutic failure through Darwinian selection.

While more and more signaling pathways are being discovered, for the most part it remains unknown how they are being put together by different cell types into complex, nonlinear, hierarchical control networks that, on the one hand, reliably maintain constant cell numbers, and on the other hand, quickly adjust to oversee the robust response to tissue damage. Theoretical approaches can fill the gap by being able to reconstruct the underlying control network, based on the observations about the aspects of cellular dynamics. We argue that while many hypothetical networks may be capable of basic cell lineage maintenance, some are much more efficient from the viewpoint of variance minimization. Thus, we developed a new methodology that can test various control networks for stability, variance, and robustness. In the example of the airway epithelium that we highlight, it turns out that the evolutionary selected, actual architecture coincides with the mathematically optimal solution that minimizes the fluctuations of cell numbers at homeostasis.},

	abstract = {The Wnt signalling pathway is involved in stem cell maintenance, differentiation and tissue development, and in so doing plays a key role in controlling the homeostasis of colorectal crypts. In response to an external Wnt stimulus, the intracellular levels of the protein beta-catenin are regulated by the proteins which make up the Wnt signalling pathway. Abnormalities in the Wnt signalling pathway have been implicated in the initiation of colorectal and other cancers. In this thesis we analyse and simplify existing models of the Wnt signalling pathway, formulate models for Wnt's control of the cell cycle in a single cell, and incorporate these into a multiscale model to describe how Wnt may control the patterns of proliferation in a colorectal crypt. A systematic asymptotic analysis of an existing ODE-based model of the Wnt signalling pathway is undertaken, highlighting the operation of different pathway components over three different timescales. Guided by this analysis we derive a simplified model which is shown to retain the essential behaviour of the Wnt pathway, recreating the accumulation and degradation of beta-catenin. We utilise our simple model by coupling it to a model of the cell cycle. Our findings agree well with the observed patterns of proliferation in healthy colon crypts. Furthermore, the model clarifies a mechanism by which common colorectal cancer mutations may cause elevated beta-catenin and Cyclin{\textbackslash}textasciitildeD levels, leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation and thereby initiating colorectal cancer. A second model for the influence of the Wnt pathway on the cell cycle is constructed to incorporate the results of a recent set of knockout experiments. This model reproduces the healthy proliferation observed in crypts and additionally recreates the results of knockout experiments by additionally including the influence of Myc and CDK4 on the cell cycle. Analysis of this model leads us to suggest novel drug targets that may reverse the effects of an early mutation in the Wnt pathway. We have helped to build a flexible software environment for cell-based simulations of healthy and cancerous tissues. We discuss the software engineering approach that we have used to develop this environment, and its suitability for scientific computing. We then use this software to perform multiscale simulations with subcellular Wnt signalling models inside individual cells, the cells forming an epithelial crypt tissue. We have used the multiscale model to compare the effect of different subcellular models on crypt dynamics and predicting the distribution of beta-catenin throughout the crypt.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has transformed biomedical research, enabling decomposition of complex tissues into disaggregated, functionally distinct cell types. For many applications, investigators wish to identify cell types with known marker genes. Typically, such cell type assignments are performed through unsupervised clustering followed by manual annotation based on these marker genes, or via "mapping" procedures to existing data. However, the manual interpretation required in the former case scales poorly to large datasets, which are also often prone to batch effects, while existing data for purified cell types must be available for the latter. Furthermore, unsupervised clustering can be error-prone, leading to under- and over- clustering of the cell types of interest. To overcome these issues we present CellAssign, a probabilistic model that leverages prior knowledge of cell type marker genes to annotate scRNA-seq data into pre-defined and de novo cell types. CellAssign automates the process of assigning cells in a highly scalable manner across large datasets while simultaneously controlling for batch and patient effects. We demonstrate the analytical advantages of CellAssign through extensive simulations and exemplify real-world utility to profile the spatial dynamics of high-grade serous ovarian cancer and the temporal dynamics of follicular lymphoma. Our analysis reveals subclonal malignant phenotypes and points towards an evolutionary interplay between immune and cancer cell populations with cancer cells escaping immune recognition.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Patterns of gene expression can be used to characterize and classify neuronal types. It is challenging, however, to generate taxonomies that fulfill the essential criteria of being comprehensive, harmonizing with conventional classification schemes, and lacking superfluous subdivisions of genuine types. To address these challenges, we used massively parallel single-cell RNA profiling and optimized computational methods on a heterogeneous class of neurons, mouse retinal bipolar cells (BCs). From a population of ∼25,000 BCs, we derived a molecular classification that identified 15 types, including all types observed previously and two novel types, one of which has a non-canonical morphology and position. We validated the classification scheme and identified dozens of novel markers using methods that match molecular expression to cell morphology. This work provides a systematic methodology for achieving comprehensive molecular classification of neurons, identifies novel neuronal types, and uncovers transcriptional differences that distinguish types within a class.},

Here, we report that Ovol2, a transcriptional repressor that inhibits epithelial‐to‐mesenchymal transition (EMT), plays a crucial role in adult skin epithelial regeneration and repair. Ovol2‐deficient mice show compromised wound healing characterized by aberrant epidermal cell migration and proliferation, as well as delayed anagen progression characterized by defects in hair follicle matrix cell proliferation and subsequent differentiation. Epidermal keratinocytes and bulge hair follicle stem cells (Bu‐HFSCs) lacking Ovol2 fail to expand in culture and display molecular alterations consistent with enhanced EMT and reduced proliferation. Live imaging of wound explants and Bu‐HFSCs reveals increased migration speed but reduced directionality, and post‐mitotic cell cycle arrest. Remarkably, simultaneous deletion of Zeb1 encoding an EMT‐promoting factor restores directional migration to Ovol2‐deficient Bu‐HFSCs. Taken together, our findings highlight the important function of an Ovol2‐Zeb1 EMT‐regulatory circuit in controlling the directional migration of epithelial stem and progenitor cells to facilitate adult skin epithelial regeneration and repair.

The control method we describe is based on nonlinear trajectory design and energy transfer methods first introduced in the orbital mechanics literature for Hamiltonian systems. For continuous therapy, the basin boundaries of attraction associated with the chemo-sensitive population and the chemo-resistant population for increasing values of chemo-concentrations have an intertwined spiral structure with extreme sensitivity to changes in chemo-concentration level as well as sensitivity with respect to resistant mutations. For time-dependent therapies, we introduce an orbit transfer method to construct continuous families of periodic (closed) orbits by switching the chemo-dose at carefully chosen times and appropriate levels to design schedules that are superior to both maximum tolerated dose (MTD) schedules and low-dose metronomic (LDM) schedules, both of which ultimately lead to fixation of sensitive cells or resistant cells. By keeping the three subpopulations of cells in competition with each other indefinitely, we avoid fixation of the cancer cell population and regrowth of a resistant tumor. The method can be viewed as a way to dynamically shape the average population fitness landscape of a tumor to steer the chemotherapeutic response curve. We show that the method is remarkably insensitive to initial conditions and small changes in chemo-dosages, an important criterion for turning the method into an actionable strategy.},

The identification of cell types and marker genes is critical for dissecting neural development and function, but the size and complexity of the brain has hindered the comprehensive discovery of cell types. We combined single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) with anatomical brain registration to create a comprehensive map of the zebrafish habenula, a conserved forebrain hub involved in pain processing and learning. Single-cell transcriptomes of ∼13,000 habenular cells with 4× cellular coverage identified 18 neuronal types and dozens of marker genes. Registration of marker genes onto a reference atlas created a resource for anatomical and functional studies and enabled the mapping of active neurons onto neuronal types following aversive stimuli. Strikingly, despite brain growth and functional maturation, cell types were retained between the larval and adult habenula. This study provides a gene expression atlas to dissect habenular development and function and offers a general framework for the comprehensive characterization of other brain regions.},

Thus, after sequencing, information about the spatial relationships between cells is lost although this knowledge is crucial for understanding cellular and tissue-level function. Recent attempts to overcome this fundamental challenge rely on employing additional in situ gene expression imaging data which can guide spatial mapping of sequenced cells. Here we present a conceptually different approach that allows to reconstruct spatial positions of cells in a variety of tissues without using reference imaging data. We ﬁrst show for several complex biological systems that distances of single cells in expression space monotonically increase with their physical distances across tissues. We therefore seek to map cells to tissue space such that this principle is optimally preserved, while matching existing imaging data when available. We show that this optimization problem can be cast as a generalized optimal transport problem and solved efﬁciently. We apply our approach successfully to reconstruct the mammalian liver and intestinal epithelium as well as ﬂy and zebraﬁsh embryos. Our results demonstrate a simple spatial expression organization principle and that this principle (or future reﬁned principles) can be used to infer, for individual cells, meaningful spatial position probabilities from the sequencing data alone.},

Epithelial tissues, such as the skin, rely on cellular plasticity of stem cells (SCs) from different niches to restore tissue function after injury. How these molecularly and functionally diverse SC populations respond to injury remains elusive. Here, we genetically labeled Lgr5- or Lgr6-expressing cells from the hair follicle bulge and interfollicular epidermis (IFE), respectively, and monitored their individual transcriptional adaptations during wound healing using single-cell transcriptomics. Both Lgr5 and Lgr6 progeny rapidly induced a genetic wound signature that, for Lgr5 progeny, included the remodeling of receptors to permit interactions with the wound environment, a property that Lgr6 progeny possessed even before wounding. When contributing to re-epithelialization, Lgr5 progeny gradually replaced their bulge identity with an IFE identity, and this process started already before Lgr5 progeny left the bulge. Altogether, this study reveals how different SCs respond and adapt to a new environment, potentially explaining cellular plasticity of many epithelial tissues.},

Studies of the bone marrow stroma have defined individual populations in the stem cell niche regulating hematopoietic regeneration and capable of initiating leukemia. Here, we use singlecell RNA-seq to define a cellular taxonomy of the mouse bone marrow stroma and its perturbation by malignancy. We identified seventeen stromal subsets expressing distinct hematopoietic regulatory genes, spanning new fibroblastic, and osteoblastic subpopulations. Emerging acute myeloid leukemia resulted in impaired osteogenic differentiation and reduced production of hematopoietic regulatory molecules necessary for normal hematopoiesis. Thus, cancer can affect tissue stroma in which they reside to disadvantage normal parenchymal cells. Our taxonomy of the regulatory stromal compartment provides experimental support for a model where malignant clone is not a destroyer of normal tissue but an architect of it, remodeling tissue stroma to enable emergent cancer.},

	abstract = {Over the last quarter century, more than 532 genes have been put forward as regulatory targets of retinoic acid. In some cases this control is direct, driven by a liganded heterodimer of retinoid receptors bound to a DNA response element; in others, it is indirect, reflecting the actions of intermediate transcription factors, non-classical associations of receptors with other proteins, or even more distant mechanisms. Given the broad range of scientific questions continually under investigation, researchers do not always have occasion to classify target genes along these lines. However, our understanding of the genetic role of retinoids will be enhanced if such a distinction can be made for each regulated gene. We have therefore evaluated published data from 1,191 papers covering 532 genes and have classified these genes into four categories according to the degree to which an hypothesis of direct versus indirect control is supported overall.
We found 27 genes that are unquestionably direct targets of the classical pathway in permissive cellular contexts (Category 3 genes), plus 105 genes that appear to be candidates, pending the results of specific additional experiments (Category 2). Data on another 267 targets are not evocative of direct or indirect regulation either way, although control by retinoic acid through some mechanism is clear (Category 1). Most of the remaining 133 targets seem to be regulated indirectly, usually through a transcriptional intermediary, in the contexts studied so far (Category 0).},

We have used two independent approaches to begin to identify downstream targets of FGF signalling in the embryo: (1) a gene trap approach and (2) cDNA subtraction, using mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells as a cellular system representative of an early window on the developing embryo. Both approaches led to the identification of a number of targets of FGF signalling, and we provide data to show that the chaperone Mrj, the tumour antigen Tum, collapsin mediator response protein Crmp, a novel transcriptional repressor Nac1 and ribophorin are all differentially regulated following FGF signalling. Independent gene trapping of Mrj previously indicated a role for the gene in embryogenesis [Development 126 (1999) 1247], and we present transcript data implicating a number of the newly isolated FGF target genes in different embryonic processes.},

	abstract = {The signaling component of the mammalian Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) family is comprised of eighteen secreted proteins that interact with four signaling tyrosine kinase FGF receptors (FGFRs). Interaction of FGF ligands with their signaling receptors is regulated by protein or proteoglycan cofactors and by extracellular binding proteins. Activated FGFRs phosphorylate specific tyrosine residues that mediate interaction with cytosolic adaptor proteins and the RAS-MAPK, PI3K-AKT, PLCγ, and STAT intracellular signaling pathways. Four structurally related intracellular non-signaling FGFs interact with and regulate the family of voltage gated sodium channels. Members of the FGF family function in the earliest stages of embryonic development and during organogenesis to maintain progenitor cells and mediate their growth, differentiation, survival, and patterning. FGFs also have roles in adult tissues where they mediate metabolic functions, tissue repair, and regeneration, often by reactivating developmental signaling pathways. Consistent with the presence of FGFs in almost all tissues and organs, aberrant activity of the pathway is associated with developmental defects that disrupt organogenesis, impair the response to injury, and result in metabolic disorders, and cancer.

In this study we examine the requirement for FGF-dependent signal transduction pathways in the regulation of Cdx gene expression. In the amphibian Xenopus laevis the earliest expression of Cdx1, Cdx2 and Cdx4 is within the developing mesoderm. We show that a functional FGF signaling pathway is required for the normal expression of all three amphibian Cdx genes during gastrula stages. We show that FGF stimulation activates signaling through both the MAP kinase pathway and the PI-3 kinase pathway in Xenopus tissue explants. However, our analysis of these pathways in gastrula stage embryos indicates that the MAP kinase pathway is required for Cdx gene expression, whereas the PI-3 kinase pathway is not. We show that FGF and wnt signaling can interact in the regulation of Cdx genes and during gastrula stages the normal expression of the Cdx genes requires the activity of both pathways. Furthermore, we show that wnt mediated Cdx regulation is independent of the MAP kinase pathway.},

	abstract = {Stochasticity is a key characteristic of intracellular processes such as gene regulation and chemical signalling. Therefore, characterizing stochastic effects in biochemical systems is essential to understand the complex dynamics of living things. Mathematical idealizations of biochemically reacting systems must be able to capture stochastic phenomena. While robust theory exists to describe such stochastic models, the computational challenges in exploring these models can be a significant burden in practice since realistic models are analytically intractable. Determining the expected behaviour and variability of a stochastic biochemical reaction network requires many probabilistic simulations of its evolution. Using a biochemical reaction network model to assist in the interpretation of time-course data from a biological experiment is an even greater challenge due to the intractability of the likelihood function for determining observation probabilities. These computational challenges have been subjects of active research for over four decades. In this review, we present an accessible discussion of the major historical developments and state-of-the-art computational techniques relevant to simulation and inference problems for stochastic biochemical reaction network models. Detailed algorithms for particularly important methods are described and complemented with Matlab® implementations. As a result, this review provides a practical and accessible introduction to computational methods for stochastic models within the life sciences community.},

Accurate quantification of these mutations from DNA sequencing of bulk tumor samples is complicated by varying tumor purity, admixture of multiple tumor clones with distinct mutations, and high aneuploidy. Standard methods for CNA inference analyze tumor samples individually, but recently DNA sequencing of multiple samples from a cancer patient - e.g. from multiple regions of a primary tumor, matched primary/metastases, or multiple time points - has become common. We introduce a new algorithm, Holistic Allele-specific Tumor Copy-number Heterogeneity (HATCHet), that infers allele and clone-specific CNAs and WGDs jointly across multiple tumor samples from the same patient, and that leverages the relationships between clones in these samples. HATCHet provides a fresh perspective on CNA inference and includes several algorithmic innovations that overcome the limitations of existing methods, resulting in a more robust approach even for single-sample analysis. We also develop MASCoTE (Multiple Allele-specific Simulation of Copy-number Tumor Evolution), a framework for generating realistic simulated multi-sample DNA sequencing data with appropriate corrections for the differences in genome lengths between the normal and tumor clone(s) present in mixed samples. HATCHet outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on 256 simulated tumor samples from 64 patients, half with WGD. HATCHet9s analysis of 49 primary tumor and metastasis samples from 10 prostate cancer patients reveals subclonal CNAs in only 29 of these samples, compared to the published reports of extensive subclonal CNAs in all samples. HATCHet9s inferred CNAs are also more consistent with the reports of polyclonal origin and limited heterogeneity of metastasis in a subset of patients. HATCHet9s analysis of 35 primary tumor and metastasis samples from 4 pancreas cancer patients reveals subclonal CNAs in 20 samples, WGDs in 3 patients, and tumor subclones that are shared across primary and metastases samples from the same patient - none of which were described in published analysis of this data. HATCHet substantially improves the analysis of CNAs and WGDs, leading to more reliable studies of tumor evolution in primary tumors and metastases.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Per-cell mutation rates varied 50-fold between individuals, and per-cell survival rates were between nearly-homeostatic and almost perfect cell doublings, equating to tumour ages between 1 and 19 years. Furthermore, reanalysing a recent dataset of 89 whole-genome sequenced healthy haematopoietic stem cells, we find 1.14 mutations per genome per cell division and near perfect cell doublings (per-cell survival rate: 0.96) during early haematopoietic development.

We show that SCIRA can correctly infer regulatory activity of transcription factors affected by high technical dropouts. In particular, SCIRA can improve sensitivity by as much as 70\% compared to differential expression analysis and current state-of-the-art methods. Importantly, SCIRA can reveal novel regulators of cell-fate in tissue-development, even for cell-types that only make up 5\% of the tissue, and can identify key novel tumor suppressor genes in cancer at single cell resolution. In summary, SCIRA will be an invaluable tool for single-cell studies aiming to accurately map activity patterns of key transcription factors during development, and how these are altered in disease.},

	abstract = {The heterogeneity in mammalian cells signaling response is largely a result of pre‐existing cell‐to‐cell variability. It is unknown whether cell‐to‐cell variability rises from biochemical stochastic fluctuations or distinct cellular states. Here, we utilize calcium response to adenosine trisphosphate as a model for investigating the structure of heterogeneity within a population of cells and analyze whether distinct cellular response states coexist. We use a functional definition of cellular state that is based on a mechanistic dynamical systems model of calcium signaling. Using Bayesian parameter inference, we obtain high confidence parameter value distributions for several hundred cells, each fitted individually. Clustering the inferred parameter distributions revealed three major distinct cellular states within the population. The existence of distinct cellular states raises the possibility that the observed variability in response is a result of structured heterogeneity between cells. The inferred parameter distribution predicts, and experiments confirm that variability in IP3R response explains the majority of calcium heterogeneity. Our work shows how mechanistic models and single‐cell parameter fitting can uncover hidden population structure and demonstrate the need for parameter inference at the single‐cell level.

Single‐cell measurements of calcium responses to ATP, in combination with analyses of the full distribution of kinetic parameters, reveal the existence of three major distinct cellular states within the population.

Calcium signaling response to ATP is used as a model to analyze whether distinct cellular response states coexist.Single‐cell parameter fitting of a differential equations model of calcium response to ATP identifies a unique kinetic signature for each single cell.Cells can be classified into three distinct cell states.Each of the three states has a distinct feedback motif that connects calcium concentration to IP3R activity.},

During EMT, cells do not necessarily exist in ‘pure’ epithelial or mesenchymal states. There are cells with mixed (or hybrid) features of the two, which are termed as the intermediate cell states (ICSs). While the exact functions of ICS remain elusive, together with EMT it appears to play important roles in embryogenesis, tissue development, and pathological processes such as cancer metastasis. Recent single cell experiments and advanced mathematical modeling have improved our capability in identifying ICS and provided a better understanding of ICS in development and disease.

Although taxonomically widespread, the molecular details of plug formation remain poorly understood, limiting our ability to manipulate the structure and understand its role in reproduction. Here I show that male mice knockouts for transglutaminase IV (Tgm4) fail to form a copulatory plug, demonstrating that this gene is necessary for plug formation and lending a powerful new genetic tool to begin characterizing plug function. Tgm4 knockout males show normal sperm count, sperm motility, and reproductive morphology. However, very little of their ejaculate migrates into the female's reproductive tract, suggesting the plug prevents ejaculate leakage. Poor ejaculate migration leads to a reduction in the proportion of oocytes fertilized. However, Tgm4 knockout males fertilized between 3–11 oocytes, which should be adequate for a normal litter. Nevertheless, females mated to Tgm4 knockout males for approximately 14 days were significantly less likely to give birth to a litter compared to females mated to wild-type males. Therefore, it appears that the plug also affects post-fertilization events such as implantation and/or gestation. This study shows that a gene influencing the viscosity of seminal fluid has a major influence on male fertility.},

Despite their promise, much more research is needed to understand how and why certain cancers fail to respond to immunotherapy and to predict which therapeutic strategies, or combinations thereof, are most appropriate for each patient. Underlying these challenges are technological needs, including methods to rapidly and thoroughly characterize the immune microenvironment of tumors, predictive tools to screen potential therapies in patient-specific ways, and sensitive, information-rich assays that allow patient monitoring of immune responses, tumor regression, and tumor dissemination during and after therapy. The newly emerging field of immunoengineering is addressing some of these challenges, and there is ample opportunity for engineers to contribute their approaches and tools to further facilitate the clinical translation of immunotherapy.

	abstract = {Complex interactions occur between tumor and host immune system at each site in the metastatic setting, the outcome of which can determine behavior ranging from dormancy to rapid growth. An additional layer of complexity arises from the understanding that cytotoxic T cells can traffic through the host circulatory system. Coupling mathematical models of local tumor-immune dynamics and systemic T cell trafficking allows us to simulate the evolution of tumor and immune cell populations in anatomically distant sites following local therapy and thus computationally evaluate immune interconnectivity. Results suggest that the presence of a secondary site may either inhibit or promote growth of the primary, depending on the capacity for immune recruitment of each tumor and the resulting systemic redistribution of T cells. Treatment such as surgical resection and radiotherapy can be simulated to estimate both the decrease in tumor volume at the local treatment-targeted site, and the change in overall tumor burden and tumor growth trajectories across all sites. Qualitatively similar responses of distant tumors to local therapy (positive and negative abscopal effects) to those reported in the clinical setting were observed. Such findings may facilitate an improved understanding of general disease kinetics in the metastatic setting: if metastatic sites are interconnected through the immune system, truly local therapy does not exist.},

	abstract = {PurposeIn an upcoming clinical trial at the Moffitt Cancer Center for women with stage 2/3 estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer, treatment with an aromatase inhibitor and a PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor combination will be investigated to lower a preoperative endocrine prognostic index (PEPI) that correlates with relapse-free survival. PEPI is fundamentally a static index, measured at the end of neoadjuvant therapy before surgery. We have developed a mathematical model of the essential components of the PEPI score to identify successful combination therapy regimens that minimize tumor burden and metastatic potential, on the basis of time-dependent trade-offs in the system.MethodsWe considered two molecular traits, CCR7 and PD-L1, which correlate with treatment response and increased metastatic risk. We used a matrix game model with the four phenotypic strategies to examine the frequency-dependent interactions of cancer cells. This game was embedded in an ecological model of tumor population-growth dynamics. The resulting model predicts evolutionary and ecological dynamics that track with changes in the PEPI score.ResultsWe considered various treatment regimens on the basis of combinations of the two therapies with drug holidays. By considering the trade off between tumor burden and metastatic potential, the optimal therapy plan was a 1-month kick start of the immune checkpoint inhibitor followed by 5 months of continuous combination therapy. Relative to a protocol giving both therapeutics together from the start, this delayed regimen resulted in transient suboptimal tumor regression while maintaining a phenotypic constitution that is more amenable to fast tumor regression for the final 5 months of therapy.ConclusionThe mathematical model provides a useful abstraction of clinical intuition, enabling hypothesis generation and testing of clinical assumptions.},

	abstract = {Summary
The response of the body to a cancer is not a unique mechanism but has many parallels with inflammation and wound healing. This article reviews the links between cancer and inflammation and discusses the implications of these links for cancer prevention and treatment. We suggest that the inflammatory cells and cytokines found in tumours are more likely to contribute to tumour growth, progression, and immunosuppression than they are to mount an effective host antitumour response. Moreover cancer susceptibility and severity may be associated with functional polymorphisms of inflammatory cytokine genes, and deletion or inhibition of inflammatory cytokines inhibits development of experimental cancer. If genetic damage is the “match that lights the fire” of cancer, some types of inflammation may provide the “fuel that feeds the flames”. Over the past ten years information about the cytokine and chemokine network has led to development of a range of cytokine/chemokine antagonists targeted at inflammatory and allergic diseases. The first of these to enter the clinic, tumour necrosis factor antagonists, have shown encouraging efficacy. In this article we have provided a rationale for the use of cytokine and chemokine blockade, and further investigation of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, in the chemoprevention and treatment of malignant diseases.},

The inflammasome, a multiprotein complex formed by NOD-like receptor (NLR) family members, has recently been shown to orchestrate multiple innate and adaptive immune responses, yet its potential role in inflammation-induced cancer has been little studied. Using the azoxymethane and dextran sodium sulfate colitis-associated colorectal cancer model, we show that caspase-1–deficient (Casp1−/−) mice have enhanced tumor formation. Surprisingly, the role of caspase-1 in tumorigenesis was not through regulation of colonic inflammation, but rather through regulation of colonic epithelial cell proliferation and apoptosis. Consequently, caspase-1–deficient mice demonstrate increased colonic epithelial cell proliferation in early stages of injury-induced tumor formation and reduced apoptosis in advanced tumors. We suggest a model in which the NLRC4 inflammasome is central to colonic inflammation-induced tumor formation through regulation of epithelial cell response to injury.},

	abstract = {Much of the vertebrate skeleton develops from cartilage templates that are progressively remodeled into bone. Lineage tracing studies in mouse suggest that chondrocytes within these templates persist and become osteoblasts, yet the underlying mechanisms of this process and whether chondrocytes can generate other derivatives remain unclear. We find that zebrafish cartilages undergo extensive remodeling and vascularization during juvenile stages to generate fat-filled bones. Growth plate chondrocytes marked by sox10 and col2a1a contribute to osteoblasts, marrow adipocytes, and mesenchymal cells within adult bones. At the edge of the hypertrophic zone, chondrocytes re-enter the cell cycle and express leptin receptor (lepr), suggesting conversion into progenitors. Further, mutation of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (mmp9) results in delayed growth plate remodeling and fewer marrow adipocytes. Our data support Mmp9-dependent growth plate remodeling and conversion of chondrocytes into osteoblasts and marrow adipocytes as conserved features of bony vertebrates.},

Three main explanatory theories (competition, angiogenesis inhibition, and proliferation inhibition) have been proposed, but precise determinants of the phenomenon remain poorly understood. Here, we formalized these theories into mathematical models and performed biological experiments to test them with empirical data. In syngeneic mice bearing two simultaneously implanted tumors, growth of only one of the tumors was significantly suppressed (61\% size reduction at day 15, P {\textless} 0.05). The competition model had to be rejected, whereas the angiogenesis inhibition and proliferation inhibition models were able to describe the data. Additional models including a theory based on distant cytotoxic log-kill effects were unable to fit the data. The proliferation inhibition model was identifiable and minimal (four parameters), and its descriptive power was validated against the data, including consistency in predictions of single tumor growth when no secondary tumor was present. This theory may also shed new light on single cancer growth insofar as it offers a biologically translatable picture of how local and global action may combine to control local tumor growth and, in particular, the role of tumor-tumor inhibition. This model offers a depiction of concomitant resistance that provides an improved theoretical basis for tumor growth control and may also find utility in therapeutic planning to avoid postsurgery metastatic acceleration.

Most recently, chronic inflammation has been described as an important factor for the development and progression of MPNs in the biological continuum from early cancer stage to the advanced myelofibrosis stage, the MPNs being described as “A Human Inflammation Model for Cancer Development“. This novel concept has been built upon clinical, experimental, genomic, immunological and not least epidemiological studies. Only a few studies have described the development of MPNs by mathematical models, and none have addressed the role of inflammation for clonal evolution and disease progression. Herein, we aim at using mathematical modelling to substantiate the concept of chronic inflammation as an important trigger and driver of MPNs.The basics of the model describe the proliferation from stem cells to mature cells including mutations of healthy stem cells to become malignant stem cells. We include a simple inflammatory coupling coping with cell death and affecting the basic model beneath. First, we describe the system without feedbacks or regulatory interactions. Next, we introduce inflammatory feedback into the system. Finally, we include other feedbacks and regulatory interactions forming the inflammatory-MPN model. Using mathematical modeling, we add further proof to the concept that chronic inflammation may be both a trigger of clonal evolution and an important driving force for MPN disease progression. Our findings support intervention at the earliest stage of cancer development to target the malignant clone and dampen concomitant inflammation.},

The traditional view that resolution of inflammation is a passive process is now being superceded by an alternative hypothesis whereby its resolution is an active, anti-inflammatory process that can be manipulated therapeutically. This shift in mindset has stimulated a resurgence of interest in the biological mechanisms by which inflammation resolves. The anti-inflammatory processes central to the resolution of inflammation revolve around macrophages and are closely related to pro-inflammatory processes mediated by neutrophils and their ability to damage healthy tissue. We develop a spatially averaged model of inflammation centring on its resolution, accounting for populations of neutrophils and macrophages and incorporating both pro- and anti-inflammatory processes. Our ordinary differential equation model exhibits two outcomes that we relate to healthy and unhealthy states. We use bifurcation analysis to investigate how variation in the system parameters affects its outcome. We find that therapeutic manipulation of the rate of macrophage phagocytosis can aid in resolving inflammation but success is critically dependent on the rate of neutrophil apoptosis. Indeed our model predicts that an effective treatment protocol would take a dual approach, targeting macrophage phagocytosis alongside neutrophil apoptosis.},

	abstract = {Pancreatic cancer is one of the most deadly types of cancer and has extremely poor prognosis. This malignancy typically induces only limited cellular immune responses, the magnitude of which can increase with the number of encountered cancer cells. On the other hand, pancreatic cancer is highly effective at evading immune responses by inducing polarization of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages into anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages, and promoting expansion of myeloid derived suppressor cells, which block the killing of cancer cells by cytotoxic T cells. These factors allow immune evasion to predominate, promoting metastasis and poor responsiveness to chemotherapies and immunotherapies. In this paper we develop a mathematical model of pancreatic cancer, and use it to qualitatively explain a variety of biomedical and clinical data. The model shows that drugs aimed at suppressing cancer growth are effective only if the immune induced cancer cell death lies within a specific range, that is, the immune system has a specific window of opportunity to effectively suppress cancer under treatment. The model results suggest that tumor growth rate is affected by complex feedback loops between the tumor cells, endothelial cells and the immune response. The relative strength of the different loops determines the cancer growth rate and its response to immunotherapy. The model could serve as a starting point to identify optimal nodes for intervention against pancreatic cancer.},

	abstract = {Combining radiotherapy with immune checkpoint blockade may offer considerable therapeutic impact if the immunosuppressive nature of the tumor microenvironment (TME) can be relieved. In this study, we used mathematical models, which can illustrate the potential synergism between immune checkpoint inhibitors and radiotherapy. A discrete-time pharmacodynamic model of the combination of radiotherapy with inhibitors of the PD1–PDL1 axis and/or the CTLA4 pathway is described. This mathematical framework describes how a growing tumor first elicits and then inhibits an antitumor immune response. This antitumor immune response is described by a primary and a secondary (or memory) response. The primary immune response appears first and is inhibited by the PD1–PDL1 axis, whereas the secondary immune response happens next and is inhibited by the CTLA4 pathway. The effects of irradiation are described by a modified version of the linear-quadratic model. This modeling offers an explanation for the reported biphasic relationship between the size of a tumor and its immunogenicity, as measured by the abscopal effect (an off-target immune response). Furthermore, it explains why discontinuing immunotherapy may result in either tumor recurrence or a durably sustained response. Finally, it describes how synchronizing immunotherapy and radiotherapy can produce synergies. The ability of the model to forecast pharmacodynamic endpoints was validated retrospectively by checking that it could describe data from experimental studies, which investigated the combination of radiotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors. In summary, a model such as this could be further used as a simulation tool to facilitate decision making about optimal scheduling of immunotherapy with radiotherapy and perhaps other types of anticancer therapies.

	abstract = {Inflammation plays a critical role in the development and progression of cancer, evident in multiple patient populations manifesting increased, non-resolving inflammation, such as inflammatory bowel disease, viral hepatitis and obesity. Given the complexity of both the inflammatory response and the process of oncogenesis, we utilize principles from the field of Translational Systems Biology to bridge the gap between basic mechanistic knowledge and clinical/epidemiologic data by integrating inflammation and oncogenesis within an agent-based model, the Inflammation and Cancer Agent-based Model (ICABM). The ICABM utilizes two previously published and clinically/epidemiologically validated mechanistic models to demonstrate the role of an increased inflammatory milieu on oncogenesis. Development of the ICABM required the creation of a generative hierarchy of the basic hallmarks of cancer to provide a foundation to ground the plethora of molecular and pathway components currently being studied. The ordering schema emphasizes the essential role of a fitness/selection frame shift to sub-organismal evolution as a basic property of cancer, where the generation of genetic instability as a negative effect for multicellular eukaryotic organisms represents the restoration of genetic plasticity used as an adaptive strategy by colonies of prokaryotic unicellular organisms. Simulations with the ICABM demonstrate that inflammation provides a functional environmental context that drives the shift to sub-organismal evolution, where increasingly inflammatory environments led to increasingly damaged genomes in microtumors (tumors below clinical detection size) and cancers. The flexibility of this platform readily facilitates tailoring the ICABM to specific cancers, their associated mechanisms and available epidemiological data. One clinical example of an epidemiological finding that could be investigated with this platform is the increased incidence of triple negative breast cancers in the premenopausal African–American population, which has been identified as having up-regulated of markers of inflammation. The fundamental nature of the ICABM suggests its usefulness as a base platform upon which additional molecular detail could be added as needed.},

Our mathematical representation of these mutations reflects the current understanding of the roles of oncogenes and anti-oncogenes in controlling cell proliferation. Numerical solutions of our model, for biologically relevant parameter values, show that the different types of mutations have quite different effects. Mutations affecting the cell response to chemical regulators, or resulting in autonomy from such regulators, cause an advancing wave of tumour cells and a receding wave of normal cells. By contrast, mutations affecting the production of a mitotic regulator cause a slow localized increase in the numbers of both normal and mutant cells. We extend our model to investigate the possible effects of an immune response to cancer by including a first order removal of mutant cells. When this removal rate exceeds a critical value, the immune system can suppress tumour growth; we derive an expression for this critical value as a function of the parameters characterizing the mutation. Our results suggest that the effectiveness of the immune response after an oncogenic mutation depends crucially on the way in which the mutation affects the biochemical control of cell division.},

Simulations of tumor growth using different levels of immune stimulating ligands, effector cells, and tumor challenge are able to reproduce data from the published studies.

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTION The copy number and intracellular localization of RNA are important regulators of gene expression. Measurement of these properties at the transcriptome scale in single cells will give answers to many questions related to gene expression and regulation. Single-molecule RNA imaging approaches, such as single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH), are powerful tools for counting and mapping RNA; however, the number of RNA species that can be simultaneously imaged in individual cells has been limited. This makes it challenging to perform transcriptomic analysis of single cells in a spatially resolved manner. Here, we report multiplexed error-robust FISH (MERFISH), a single-molecule imaging method that allows thousands of RNA species to be imaged in single cells by using combinatorial FISH labeling with encoding schemes capable of detecting and/or correcting errors.
RATIONALE We labeled each cellular RNA with a set of encoding probes, which contain targeting sequences that bind the RNA and readout sequences that bind fluorescently labeled readout probes. Each RNA species is encoded with a particular combination of readout sequences. We used successive rounds of hybridization and imaging, each with a different readout probe, to identify the readout sequences bound to each RNA and to decode the RNA. In principle, combinatorial labeling allows the number of detectable RNA species to grow exponentially with the number of imaging rounds, but the detection errors also increase exponentially. To combat such accumulating errors, we exploited error-robust encoding schemes used in digital electronics, such as the extended Hamming code, in the design of our encoding probes but modified these schemes in order to account for the error properties in FISH measurements. We assigned each RNA a binary word in our modified Hamming code and encoded the RNA with a combination of readout sequences according to this binary word.
RESULTS We first imaged 140 RNA species in human fibroblast cells using MERFISH with 16 rounds of hybridization and a modified Hamming code capable of both error detection and correction. We obtained {\textasciitilde}80\% detection efficiency and observed excellent correlation of RNA copy numbers determined with MERFISH with both bulk RNA sequencing data and conventional smFISH measurements of individual genes. Next, we used an alternative MERFISH encoding scheme, which is capable of detecting but not correcting errors, to image 1001 RNA species in individual cells using only 14 rounds of hybridization. The observed RNA copy numbers again correlate well with bulk sequencing data. However, the detection efficiency is only one-third that of the error-correcting encoding scheme. We performed correlation analysis of the 104 to 106 pairs of measured genes and identified many covarying gene groups that share common regulatory elements. Such grouping allowed us to hypothesize potential functions of {\textasciitilde}100 unannotated or partially annotated genes of unknown functions. We further analyzed correlations in the spatial distributions of different RNA species and identified groups of RNAs with different distribution patterns in the cell.
DISCUSSION This highly multiplexed imaging approach enables analyses based on the variation and correlation of copy numbers and spatial distributions of a large number of RNA species within single cells. Such analyses should facilitate the delineation of regulatory networks and in situ identification of cell types. We envision that this approach will allow spatially resolved transcriptomes to be determined for single cells. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/348/6233/aaa6090/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint MERFISH for transcriptome imaging. Numerous RNA species can be identified, counted, and localized in a single cell by using MERFISH, a single-molecule imaging approach that uses combinatorial labeling and sequential imaging with encoding schemes capable of detection and/or correction of errors. This highly multiplexed measurement of individual RNAs can be used to compute the gene expression profile and noise, covariation in expression among different genes, and spatial distribution of RNAs within single cells.
Knowledge of the expression profile and spatial landscape of the transcriptome in individual cells is essential for understanding the rich repertoire of cellular behaviors. Here, we report multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH), a single-molecule imaging approach that allows the copy numbers and spatial localizations of thousands of RNA species to be determined in single cells. Using error-robust encoding schemes to combat single-molecule labeling and detection errors, we demonstrated the imaging of 100 to 1000 distinct RNA species in hundreds of individual cells. Correlation analysis of the {\textasciitilde}104 to 106 pairs of genes allowed us to constrain gene regulatory networks, predict novel functions for many unannotated genes, and identify distinct spatial distribution patterns of RNAs that correlate with properties of the encoded proteins.
A single-molecule imaging method allows simultaneous measurement of 1000 RNA species in single cells.

	abstract = {Keratoconus is a common degenerative corneal disease that can lead to significant visual morbidity, and both genetic and environmental factors have been implicated in its pathogenesis. We compared the transcriptome of keratoconus and control epithelium using RNA-Seq. Epithelial tissues were obtained prior to surgery from keratoconus and myopia control patients, undergoing collagen cross-linking and photorefractive keratectomy, respectively. We identified major differences in keratoconus linked to cell-cell communication, cell signalling and cellular metabolism. The genes associated with the Hedgehog, Wnt and Notch1 signaling pathways were down-regulated in keratoconus. We also identified plasmolipin and Notch1 as being significantly reduced in keratoconus for both gene and protein expression (p {\textless} 0.05). Plasmolipin is a novel protein identified in human corneal epithelium, and has been demonstrated to have a key role in epithelial cell differentiation in other tissues. This study shows altered gene and protein expression of these three proteins in keratoconus, and further studies are clearly warranted to confirm the functional role of these proteins in the pathogenesis of keratoconus.},

While some of the newer models allow for plasticity, or de-differentiation, there is no consensus on the mechanisms driving this. Recent experimental evidence suggests that tumor microenvironment factors like hypoxia, acidosis, and nutrient deprivation have causative roles.SummaryTo settle the dissonance between the mounting experimental evidence surrounding the effects of the microenvironment on tumor stemness, we propose a continuous mathematical model where we model microenvironmental perturbations like forces, which then shape the distribution of stemness within the tumor. We propose methods by which to systematically measure and characterize these forces, and show results of a simple experiment which support our claims.},

We illustrate our method on a collection of experiments measuring the response of genetically diverse breast cancer cell lines to an array of ligands. Each experiment consists of a cell line–ligand combination, and contains time-course measurements of the early signalling kinases MAPK and AKT at two different ligand dose levels. By imposing appropriate structural constraints and respecting the multi-indexed structure of the data, the analysis of clusters can be optimized for biological interpretation and therapeutic understanding. We then perform a systematic, large-scale exploration of mechanistic models of MAPK–AKT crosstalk for each cluster. This analysis allows us to quantify the heterogeneity of breast cancer cell subtypes, and leads to hypotheses about the signalling mechanisms that mediate the response of the cell lines to ligands.},

Cell-to-cell transcriptional variability in otherwise homogeneous cell populations plays an important role in tissue function and development. Single-cell RNA sequencing can characterize this variability in a transcriptome-wide manner. However, technical variation and the confounding between variability and mean expression estimates hinder meaningful comparison of expression variability between cell populations. To address this problem, we introduce an analysis approach that extends the BASiCS statistical framework to derive a residual measure of variability that is not confounded by mean expression. This includes a robust procedure for quantifying technical noise in experiments where technical spike-in molecules are not available. We illustrate how our method provides biological insight into the dynamics of cell-to-cell expression variability, highlighting a synchronization of biosynthetic machinery components in immune cells upon activation. In contrast to the uniform up-regulation of the biosynthetic machinery, CD4+ T cells show heterogeneous up-regulation of immune-related and lineage-defining genes during activation and differentiation.},

Here we propose a Markov process model to derive a chromosomal equilibrium distribution of randomly-moving molecules as a functional consequence of spatially organized genome 3D structures. The model calculates steady-state distributions (SSD) from Hi-C data as quantitative measures of each chromatin region's dynamic accessibility for transcription factors and histone modification enzymes. Different from other Hi-C derived features such as compartment A/B and interaction hubs, or traditional methods measuring chromatin accessibility such as DNase-seq and FAIRE-seq, SSD considers both chromatin–chromatin and protein–chromatin interactions. Through our model, we find that SSD could capture the chromosomal equilibrium distributions of activation histone modifications and transcription factors. Compared with compartment A/B, SSD has higher correlations with the binding of these histone modifications and transcription factors. In addition, we find that genes located in high SSD regions tend to be expressed at higher level. Furthermore, we track the change of genome organization during stem cell differentiation, and propose a two-stage model to explain the dynamic change of SSD and gene expression during differentiation, where chromatin organization genes first gain chromatin accessibility and are expressed before lineage-specific genes do. We conclude that SSD is a novel and better measure of dynamic chromatin activity and accessibility.},

In this perspective article, we address the effects of such phenotype switching on T cell targeting of tumor cells. During the EMT-like switch in phenotype, a concomitant change in expression of multiple tumor antigens occurs. Melanoma cells undergoing EMT escape from killing by T cells specific for antigens whose expression is downregulated by this process. We discuss melanoma antigens whose expression is influenced by EMT. We assess the effect of changes in the expressed tumor antigen repertoire on T-cell mediated tumor recognition and killing. In addition to escape from T cell immunity via changes in antigen expression, mesenchymal-like melanoma cells are generally more resistant to classical chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, we demonstrate that when targeting antigens whose expression is unaltered during EMT, the capacity of T cells to kill melanoma cell lines in vitro is not influenced by their phenotype. When considering immune therapies such as cancer vaccination, these data suggest escape from T cell killing due to phenotype switching in melanoma could potentially be avoided by careful selection of target antigen.},

	abstract = {Mapping the vertebrate developmental landscape
As embryos develop, numerous cell types with distinct functions and morphologies arise from pluripotent cells. Three research groups have used single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze the transcriptional changes accompanying development of vertebrate embryos (see the Perspective by Harland). Wagner et al. sequenced the transcriptomes of more than 90,000 cells throughout zebrafish development to reveal how cells differentiate during axis patterning, germ layer formation, and early organogenesis. Farrell et al. profiled the transcriptomes of tens of thousands of embryonic cells and applied a computational approach to construct a branching tree describing the transcriptional trajectories that lead to 25 distinct zebrafish cell types. The branching tree revealed how cells change their gene expression as they become more and more specialized. Briggs et al. examined whole frog embryos, spanning zygotic genome activation through early organogenesis, to map cell states and differentiation across all cell lineages over time. These data and approaches pave the way for the comprehensive reconstruction of transcriptional trajectories during development.

High-throughput mapping of cellular differentiation hierarchies from single-cell data promises to empower systematic interrogations of vertebrate development and disease. Here we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to {\textgreater}92,000 cells from zebrafish embryos during the first day of development. Using a graph-based approach, we mapped a cell-state landscape that describes axis patterning, germ layer formation, and organogenesis. We tested how clonally related cells traverse this landscape by developing a transposon-based barcoding approach (TracerSeq) for reconstructing single-cell lineage histories. Clonally related cells were often restricted by the state landscape, including a case in which two independent lineages converge on similar fates. Cell fates remained restricted to this landscape in embryos lacking the chordin gene. We provide web-based resources for further analysis of the single-cell data.

	abstract = {Diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is associated with a dismal prognosis despite current best therapies; therefore new treatment strategies are urgently required. Numerous studies have suggested that epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) contributes to early-stage dissemination of cancer cells and is pivotal for invasion and metastasis of PDAC1,2,3,4. EMT is associated with phenotypic conversion of epithelial cells into mesenchymal-like cells in cell culture conditions, although such defined mesenchymal conversion (with spindle-shaped morphology) of epithelial cells in vivo is rare, with quasi-mesenchymal phenotypes occasionally observed in the tumour (partial EMT)5,6. Most studies exploring the functional role of EMT in tumours have depended on cell-culture-induced loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments involving EMT-inducing transcription factors such as Twist, Snail and Zeb1 (refs 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10). Therefore, the functional contribution of EMT to invasion and metastasis remains unclear4,6, and genetically engineered mouse models to address a causal connection are lacking. Here we functionally probe the role of EMT in PDAC by generating mouse models of PDAC with deletion of Snail or Twist, two key transcription factors responsible for EMT. EMT suppression in the primary tumour does not alter the emergence of invasive PDAC, systemic dissemination or metastasis. Suppression of EMT leads to an increase in cancer cell proliferation with enhanced expression of nucleoside transporters in tumours, contributing to enhanced sensitivity to gemcitabine treatment and increased overall survival of mice. Collectively, our study suggests that Snail- or Twist-induced EMT is not rate-limiting for invasion and metastasis, but highlights the importance of combining EMT inhibition with chemotherapy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.},

A gene regulatory network that defines ventral, intermediate, and dorsal domains along the dorsal–ventral (D–V) axis of the arch has emerged from studies in zebrafish and mice, but the temporal dynamics of this process remain unclear. To define cell fate trajectories in the arches we have performed quantitative gene expression analyses of D–V patterning genes in pharyngeal arch primordia in zebrafish and mice. Using NanoString technology to measure transcript numbers per cell directly we show that, in many cases, genes expressed in similar D–V domains and induced by similar signals vary dramatically in their temporal profiles. This suggests that cellular responses to D-V patterning signals are likely shaped by the baseline kinetics of target gene expression. Furthermore, similarities in the temporal dynamics of genes that occupy distinct pathways suggest novel shared modes of regulation. Incorporating these gene expression kinetics into our computational models for the mandibular arch improves the accuracy of patterning, and facilitates temporal comparisons between species. These data suggest that the magnitude and timing of target gene expression help diversify responses to patterning signals during craniofacial development.},

Recognition that susceptibility arises through the combination of multiple genetic pathways that influence liability factors in a nonlinear manner suggests that a process of 'decanalization' contributes to the epidemic nature of common genetic diseases. The rapid evolution of the human genome combined with marked environmental and cultural perturbation in the past two generations might lead to the uncovering of cryptic genetic variation that is a major source of disease susceptibility.},

Many large real-world networks are comprised of well-defined and meaningful smaller modules. While engineered networks are designed and refined by humans with particular goals in mind, biological networks are created by the selective pressures of evolution. In this paper, we seek to define aspects of network architecture that are shared among different types of evolved biological networks. First, we developed a new mathematical model, the Stochastic Block Model with Path Selection (SBM-PS) that simulates biological network formation based on the selection of edges that increase clustering. SBM-PS can produce modular networks whose properties resemble those of real networks. Second, we analyzed three real networks of very different types, and showed that all three can be fit well by the SBM-PS model. Third, we showed that modular elements within the three networks correspond to meaningful biological structures. The networks chosen for analysis were a proteomic network composed of all proteins required for mitochondrial function in budding yeast, a mesoscale anatomical network composed of axonal connections among regions of the mouse brain, and the connectome of individual neurons in the nematode C. elegans. We find that the three networks have common architectural features, and each can be divided into subnetworks with characteristic topologies that control specific phenotypic outputs.},

	abstract = {Tumors are not static masses of cells but dynamic ecosystems where cancer cells experience constant turnover and evolve fitness-enhancing phenotypes. Selection for different phenotypes may vary with (1) the tumor niche (edge or core), (2) cell turnover rates, (3) the nature of the tradeoff between traits, and (4) whether deaths occur in response to demographic or environmental stochasticity. Using a spatially-explicit agent-based model, we observe how two traits (proliferation rate and migration speed) evolve under different tradeoff conditions with different turnover rates. Migration rate is favored over proliferation at the tumor’s edge and vice-versa for the interior. Increasing cell turnover rates slightly slows tumor growth but accelerates the rate of evolution for both proliferation and migration. The absence of a tradeoff favors ever higher values for proliferation and migration, while a convex tradeoff tends to favor proliferation, often promoting the coexistence of a generalist and specialist phenotype. A concave tradeoff favors migration at low death rates, but switches to proliferation at higher death rates. Mortality via demographic stochasticity favors proliferation, and environmental stochasticity favors migration. While all of these diverse factors contribute to the ecology, heterogeneity, and evolution of a tumor, their effects may be predictable and empirically accessible.},

These statistical characterizations of the gene expression distribution are critical for understanding expression variation and for selecting marker genes for population heterogeneity. However, scRNA-seq data are noisy, with each cell typically sequenced at low coverage, thus making it difficult to infer properties of the gene expression distribution from raw counts. Based on a reexamination of nine public datasets, we propose a simple technical noise model for scRNA-seq data with unique molecular identifiers (UMI). We develop deconvolution of single-cell expression distribution (DESCEND), a method that deconvolves the true cross-cell gene expression distribution from observed scRNA-seq counts, leading to improved estimates of properties of the distribution such as dispersion and nonzero fraction. DESCEND can adjust for cell-level covariates such as cell size, cell cycle, and batch effects. DESCEND’s noise model and estimation accuracy are further evaluated through comparisons to RNA FISH data, through data splitting and simulations and through its effectiveness in removing known batch effects. We demonstrate how DESCEND can clarify and improve downstream analyses such as finding differentially expressed genes, identifying cell types, and selecting differentiation markers.},

Hematopoiesis provides an accessible system for studying the principles underlying cell-fate decisions in stem cells. Proposed models of hematopoiesis suggest that quantitative changes in lineage-specific transcription factors (LS-TFs) underlie cell-fate decisions. However, evidence for such models is lacking as TF levels are typically measured via RNA expression rather than by analyzing temporal changes in protein abundance. Here, we used single-cell mass cytometry and absolute quantification by mass spectrometry to capture the temporal dynamics of TF protein expression in individual cells during human erythropoiesis. We found that LS-TFs from alternate lineages are co-expressed, as proteins, in individual early progenitor cells and quantitative changes of LS-TFs occur gradually rather than abruptly to direct cell-fate decisions. Importantly, upregulation of a megakaryocytic TF in early progenitors is sufficient to deviate cells from an erythroid to a megakaryocyte trajectory, showing that quantitative changes in protein abundance of LS-TFs in progenitors can determine alternate cell fates.},

Subsets of long-lived, tumor-initiating stem cells often escape cancer therapies. However, sources and mechanisms that generate tumor heterogeneity and drug-resistant cell population are still unfolding. Here, we devise a functional reporter system to lineage trace and/or genetic ablate signaling in TGF-$\beta$-activated squamous cell carcinoma stem cells (SCC-SCs). Dissecting TGF-$\beta$’s impact on malignant progression, we demonstrate that TGF-$\beta$ concentrating near tumor-vasculature generates heterogeneity in TGF-$\beta$ signaling at tumor-stroma interface and bestows slower-cycling properties to neighboring SCC-SCs. While non-responding progenies proliferate faster and accelerate tumor growth, TGF-$\beta$-responding progenies invade, aberrantly differentiate, and affect gene expression. Intriguingly, TGF-$\beta$-responding SCC-SCs show increased protection against anti-cancer drugs, but slower-cycling alone does not confer survival. Rather, TGF-$\beta$ transcriptionally activates p21, which stabilizes NRF2, thereby markedly enhancing glutathione metabolism and diminishing effectiveness of anti-cancer therapeutics. Together, these findings establish a surprising non-genetic paradigm for TGF-$\beta$ signaling in fueling heterogeneity in SCC-SCs, tumor characteristics, and drug resistance.},

	abstract = {Summary
TGF-$\beta$ signaling can be pro-tumorigenic or tumor suppressive. We investigated this duality in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), which, with other gastrointestinal cancers, exhibits frequent inactivation of the TGF-$\beta$ mediator Smad4. We show that TGF-$\beta$ induces an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), generally considered a pro-tumorigenic event. However, in TGF-$\beta$-sensitive PDA cells, EMT becomes lethal by converting TGF-$\beta$-induced Sox4 from an enforcer of tumorigenesis into a promoter of apoptosis. This is the result of an EMT-linked remodeling of the cellular transcription factor landscape, including the repression of the gastrointestinal lineage-master regulator Klf5. Klf5 cooperates with Sox4 in oncogenesis and prevents Sox4-induced apoptosis. Smad4 is required for EMT but dispensable for Sox4 induction by TGF-$\beta$. TGF-$\beta$-induced Sox4 is thus geared to bolster progenitor identity, whereas simultaneous Smad4-dependent EMT strips Sox4 of an essential partner in oncogenesis. Our work demonstrates that TGF-$\beta$ tumor suppression functions through an EMT-mediated disruption of a lineage-specific transcriptional network.},

	abstract = {Objective The crypt population in the human intestine is dynamic: crypts can divide to produce two new daughter crypts through a process termed crypt fission, but whether this is balanced by a second process to remove crypts, as recently shown in mouse models, is uncertain. We examined whether crypt fusion (the process of two neighbouring crypts fusing into a single daughter crypt) occurs in the human colon.
Design We used somatic alterations in the gene cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) as lineage tracing markers to assess the clonality of bifurcating colon crypts (n=309 bifurcating crypts from 13 patients). Mathematical modelling was used to determine whether the existence of crypt fusion can explain the experimental data, and how the process of fusion influences the rate of crypt fission.
Results In 55\% (21/38) of bifurcating crypts in which clonality could be assessed, we observed perfect segregation of clonal lineages to the respective crypt arms. Mathematical modelling showed that this frequency of perfect segregation could not be explained by fission alone (p{\textless}10−20). With the rates of fission and fusion taken to be approximately equal, we then used the distribution of CCO-deficient patch size to estimate the rate of crypt fission, finding a value of around 0.011 divisions/crypt/year.
Conclusions We have provided the evidence that human colonic crypts undergo fusion, a potential homeostatic process to regulate total crypt number. The existence of crypt fusion in the human colon adds a new facet to our understanding of the highly dynamic and plastic phenotype of the colonic epithelium.},

Despite the multiclonal nature of the disease, tumour control probability for conventional treatment plans is modelled on the assumption that tumour cells in the target region respond identically and independently. Here, using tumour cell subpopulations with different radiation sensitivities from prostate tumour cell lines, we show that radiation resistant cells enhance the survival and radiation resistance of radio-sensitive cells in spheroids but not in monolayer culture. Mathematical modelling indicates that these phenotypic changes result from both competitive and antagonistic cellular interactions in spheroids. Interactions mediated by oxygen constraints define the spatial localisation of the cell populations in spheroids and in xenografts, while those mediated by paracrine signals further modify the microenvironment. Our results show new mechanisms of radiotherapy resistance mediated by cellular interactions and by the microenvironment.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Objective: Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been hypothesized to initiate and drive tumor growth and recurrence due to their self-renewal ability. If correct, this hypothesis implies that successful therapy must focus primarily on eradication of this CSC fraction. However, recent evidence suggests stemness is niche dependent and may represent one of many phenotypic states that can be accessed by many cancer genotypes when presented with specific environmental cues. A better understanding of the relationship of stemness to niche-related phenotypic plasticity could lead to alternative treatment strategies. Methods: Here, we investigate the role of environmental context in the expression of stem-like cell properties through in-silico simulation of ductal carcinoma. We develop a two-dimensional hybrid discrete-continuum cellular automata model to describe the single-cell scale dynamics of multicellular tissue formation. Through a suite of simulations, we investigate interactions between a phenotypically heterogeneous cancer cell population and a dynamic environment. Results: We generate homeostatic ductal structures that consist of a mixture of stem and differentiated cells governed by both intracellular and environmental dynamics. We demonstrate that a wide spectrum of tumor-like histologies can result from these structures by varying microenvironmental parameters. Conclusion: Niche driven phenotypic plasticity offers a simple first-principle explanation for the diverse ductal structures observed in histological sections from breast cancer. Significance: Conventional models of carcinogenesis largely focus on mutational events. We demonstrate that variations in the environmental niche can produce intraductal cancers independent of genetic changes in the resident cells. Therapies targeting the microenvironmental niche may offer an alternative cancer prevention strategy.},

Whether variants confer a fitness advantage or rise to detectable frequencies by chance, however, remains largely unknown. Here, by combining blood sequencing data from {\textasciitilde}50,000 individuals, we reveal how mutation, genetic drift and fitness differences combine to shape the genetic diversity of healthy blood (9clonal haematopoiesis9). By analysing the spectrum of variant allele frequencies we quantify fitness advantages for key pathogenic variants and genes and provide bounds on the number of haematopoietic stem cells. Positive selection, not drift, is the major force shaping clonal haematopoiesis. The remarkably wide variation in variant allele frequencies observed across individuals is driven by chance differences in the timing of mutation acquisition combined with differences in the cell-intrinsic fitness effect of variants. Contrary to the widely held view that clonal haematopoiesis is driven by ageing-related alterations in the stem cell niche, the data are consistent with the age dependence being driven simply by continuing risk of mutations and subsequent clonal expansions that lead to increased detectability at older ages.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Population modeling aims to capture and predict the dynamics of cell populations in constant or fluctuating environments. At the elementary level, population growth proceeds through sequential divisions of individual cells. Due to stochastic effects, populations of cells are inherently heterogeneous in phenotype, and some phenotypic variables have an effect on division or survival rates, as can be seen in partial drug resistance. Therefore, when modeling population dynamics where the control of growth and division is phenotype dependent, the corresponding model must take account of the underlying cellular heterogeneity. The finite state projection (FSP) approach has often been used to analyze the statistics of independent cells. Here, we extend the FSP analysis to explore the coupling of cell dynamics and biomolecule dynamics within a population. This extension allows a general framework with which to model the state occupations of a heterogeneous, isogenic population of dividing and expiring cells. The method is demonstrated with a simple model of cell-cycle progression, which we use to explore possible dynamics of drug resistance phenotypes in dividing cells. We use this method to show how stochastic single-cell behaviors affect population level efficacy of drug treatments, and we illustrate how slight modifications to treatment regimens may have dramatic effects on drug efficacy.},

Organism aging is characterized by increased inflammation and decreased stem cell function, yet the relationship between these factors remains incompletely understood. This study shows that aged hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) exhibit increased ground-stage NF-κB activity, which enhances their responsiveness to undergo differentiation and loss of self-renewal in response to inflammation. The study identifies Rad21/cohesin as a critical mediator of NF-κB signaling, which increases chromatin accessibility in the vicinity of NF-κB target genes in response to inflammation. Rad21 is required for normal differentiation, but limits self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) during aging and inflammation in an NF-κB–dependent manner. HSCs from aged mice fail to down-regulate Rad21/cohesin and inflammation/differentiation signals in the resolution phase of inflammation. Inhibition of cohesin/NF-κB reverts hypersensitivity of aged HSPCs to inflammation-induced differentiation and myeloid-biased HSCs with disrupted/reduced expression of Rad21/cohesin are increasingly selected during aging. Together, Rad21/cohesin-mediated NF-κB signaling limits HSPC function during aging and selects for cohesin-deficient HSCs with myeloid-skewed differentiation.},

	abstract = {Stem cells play a central role in the regeneration and repair of multicellular organisms. However, it remains far from trivial to reliably identify them. Despite decades of work, current techniques to isolate hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) based on cell-surface markers only result in 50\% purity, i.e. half of the sorted cells are not stem cells when functionally tested. Modern microscopy techniques allow us to follow single cells and their progeny for up to weeks in vitro, while recording the cell fates and lifetime of each individual cell. This cell tracking generates so-called lineage trees. Here, we propose statistical techniques to determine if the initial cell in a lineage tree was a HSC. We apply these techniques to murine hematopoietic lineage trees, revealing that 18\% of the trees in our HSC dataset display a unique signature, and this signature is compatible with these trees having started from a true stem cell. Assuming 50\% purity of HSC empirical datasets, this corresponds to a 0.35 power of the test, and the type-1-error is estimated to be 0.047. In summary, this study shows that statistical analysis of lineage trees could improve the classification of cells, which is currently done based on bio-markers only. Our statistical techniques are not limited to mammalian stem cell biology. Any type of single cell lineage trees, be it from bacteria, single cell eukaryotes, or single cells in a multicellular organism can be investigated. We expect this to contribute to a better understanding of the molecules influencing cellular dynamics at the single cell level.},

	abstract = {Multistep cell fate transitions with stepwise changes of transcriptional profiles are common to many developmental, regenerative and pathological processes. The multiple intermediate cell lineage states can serve as differentiation checkpoints or branching points for channeling cells to more than one lineages. However, mechanisms underlying these transitions remain elusive. Here, we explored gene regulatory circuits that can generate multiple intermediate cellular states with stepwise modulations of transcription factors. With unbiased searching in the network topology space, we found a motif family containing a large set of networks can give rise to four attractors with the stepwise regulations of transcription factors, which limit the reversibility of three consecutive steps of the lineage transition. We found that there is an enrichment of these motifs in a transcriptional network controlling the early T cell development, and a mathematical model based on this network recapitulates multistep transitions in the early T cell lineage commitment. By calculating the energy landscape and minimum action paths for the T cell model, we quantified the stochastic dynamics of the critical factors in response to the differentiation signal with fluctuations. These results are in good agreement with experimental observations and they suggest the stable characteristics of the intermediate states in the T cell differentiation. These dynamical features may help to direct the cells to correct lineages during development. Our findings provide general design principles for multistep cell linage transitions and new insights into the early T cell development. The network motifs containing a large family of topologies can be useful for analyzing diverse biological systems with multistep transitions.},

	abstract = {Most species maintain abundant genetic variation and experience a range of environmental conditions, yet phenotypic variation is low. That is, development is robust to changes in genotype and environment. It has been claimed that this robustness, termed canalization, evolves because of long-term natural selection for optimal phenotypes. We show that the developmental process, here modeled as a network of interacting transcriptional regulators, constrains the genetic system to produce canalization, even without selection toward an optimum. The extent of canalization, measured as the insensitivity to mutation of a network's equilibrium state, depends on the complexity of the network, such that more highly connected networks evolve to be more canalized. We argue that canalization may be an inevitable consequence of complex developmental–genetic processes and thus requires no explanation in terms of evolution to suppress phenotypic variation.},

We analyse individual haematopoietic stem cells throughout differentiation into megakaryocytic–erythroid and granulocytic–monocytic lineages. The observed expression dynamics are incompatible with the assumption that stochastic switching between PU.1 and GATA1 precedes and initiates megakaryocytic–erythroid versus granulocytic–monocytic lineage decision-making. Rather, our findings suggest that these transcription factors are only executing and reinforcing lineage choice once made.

A homing guide RNA (hgRNA) that directs CRISPR-Cas9 to its own DNA locus can diversify its sequence and act as an expressed genetic barcode. Kalhor et al. engineered a mouse line carrying 60 independent loci of hgRNAs, thus generating a large number of unique barcodes in various embryonic and extraembryonic tissues in fully developed mice. This method demonstrates lineage tracing from the very first branches of the development tree up to organogenesis events and was used to elucidate embryonic brain patterning.
Science, this issue p. eaat9804
Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONThe remarkable development of a single cell, the zygote, into the full organism occurs through a complex series of division and differentiation events that resemble a tree, with the zygote at the base branching through lineages that end in the terminal cell types at the top. Characterizing this tree of development has long been a subject of interest, and the combination of modern genome engineering and sequencing technologies promises a powerful strategy in its service: in vivo barcoding. For in vivo barcoding, heritable random mutations are induced to accumulate during development and sequenced post hoc to reconstruct the lineage tree. Demonstrations thus far have largely focused on lower vertebrates and have used a barcoding element with a constrained window of activity for clonal tracing of individual cells or cell types. Implementation in mammalian model systems, such as the mouse, incurs unique challenges that require major enhancements.
RATIONALETo address the complexity of mammalian development, we reasoned that multiple independent in vivo barcoding elements could be deployed in parallel to exponentially expand their recording power. Independence requires both an absence of cross-talk between the elements and an absence of interference between their mutation outcomes. A system with the potential to deliver on these requirements is homing CRISPR, a modified version of canonical CRISPR wherein the homing guide RNA (hgRNA) combines with CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease for repeated targeting of its own locus, leading to diverse mutational outcomes. Therefore, in mouse embryonic stem cells, we scattered multiple hgRNA loci with distinct spacers in the genome to serve as barcoding elements. With this arrangement, each hgRNA acts independently as a result of its unique spacer sequence, and undesirable deletion events between multiple adjacent cut sites are less likely. Using these cells, we generated a chimeric mouse with 60 hgRNAs as the founder of the MARC1 (Mouse for Actively Recording Cells 1) line that enables barcoding and recording of cell lineages.
RESULTSIn the absence of Cas9, hgRNAs are stable and dormant; to initiate barcoding, we crossed MARC1 mice with Cas9 knock-in mice. In the resulting offspring, hgRNAs were activated, creating diverse mutations such that an estimated 1023 distinct barcode combinations can be generated with only 10 hgRNAs. Furthermore, hgRNAs showed a range of activity profiles, with some mutating soon after conception while others exhibited lower activity through most of the gestation period. This range resulted in sustained barcoding throughout gestation and recording of developmental lineages: Each cell inherits a set of unique mutations that are passed on to its daughter cells, where further unique mutations can be added. Consequently, at any stage in such developmentally barcoded mice, closely related cells have a more similar mutation profile, or barcode, than the more distant ones. These recordings remain embedded in the genomes of the cells and can be extracted by sequencing.We used these recordings to carry out bottom-up reconstruction of the mouse lineage tree, starting with the first branches that emerged after the zygote, and observed robust reconstruction of the correct tree. We also investigated axis development in the brain by sequencing barcodes from the left and right side of the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain regions. We found that barcodes from the left and right sides of the same region were more closely related than those from different regions; this result suggests that in the precursor of the brain, commitment to the anterior-posterior axis is established prior to the lateral axis.
CONCLUSIONThis system provides an enabling and versatile platform for in vivo barcoding and lineage tracing in a mammalian model system. It can straightforwardly create developmentally barcoded mice in which lineage information is prerecorded in cell genomes. Combining multiple independently acting molecular recording devices greatly enhances their capacity and allows for reliable information recovery and reconstruction of deep lineage trees. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/361/6405/eaat9804/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Developmental barcoding and lineage reconstruction in mice.Crossing the MARC1 mouse line, which carries multiple hgRNAs, with a CRISPR-Cas9 mouse line results in developmentally barcoded offspring that record lineages in their cells.

In vivo barcoding using nuclease-induced mutations is a powerful approach for recording biological information, including developmental lineages; however, its application in mammalian systems has been limited. We present in vivo barcoding in the mouse with multiple homing guide RNAs that each generate hundreds of mutant alleles and combine to produce an exponential diversity of barcodes. Activation upon conception and continued mutagenesis through gestation resulted in developmentally barcoded mice wherein information is recorded in lineage-specific mutations. We used these recordings for reliable post hoc reconstruction of the earliest lineages and investigation of axis development in the brain. Our results provide an enabling and versatile platform for in vivo barcoding and lineage tracing in a mammalian model system.
Multiple, independent barcoding elements enable lineage tracing in the whole mouse embryo during brain development and patterning.

	abstract = {PU.1 is an ETS-family transcription factor that plays a broad range of roles in hematopoiesis. A direct regulator of myeloid, dendritic-cell, and B cell functional programs, and a well-known antagonist of terminal erythroid cell differentiation, it is also expressed in the earliest stages of T-cell development of each cohort of intrathymic pro-T cells. Its expression in this context appears to give T-cell precursors initial, transient access to myeloid and dendritic cell developmental competence and therefore to represent a source of antagonism or delay of T-cell lineage commitment. However, it has remained uncertain until recently why T-cell development is also intensely dependent upon PU.1. Here, we review recent work that sheds light on the molecular biology of PU.1 action across the genome in pro-T cells and identifies the genes that depend on PU.1 for their correct regulation. This work indicates modes of chromatin engagement, pioneering, and cofactor recruitment (“coregulator theft”) by PU.1 as well as gene network interactions that not only affect specific target genes but also have system-wide regulatory consequences, amplifying the impact of PU.1 beyond its own direct binding targets. The genes directly regulated by PU.1 also suggest a far-reaching transformation of cell biology and signaling potential between the early stages of T-cell development when PU.1 is expressed and when it is silenced. These cell-biological functions can be important to distinguish fetal from adult T-cell development and have the potential to illuminate aspects of thymic function that have so far remained the most mysterious.},

Turning on a heritable label in HSCs and measuring the kinetics of label emergence in downstream compartments reveal rates of differentiation and self-renewal of HSCs and progenitor cells, whereas endogenous HSC barcoding probes physiological precursor-product relationships. Labels have been inserted at different stages of the hematopoietic differentiation hierarchy. Recent genetic and functional evidence suggests a phenotype (Tie2+) for tip HSCs. Fate mapping shows that many tip HSCs regularly feed into downstream stages, with individual cells contributing infrequently. Stem and progenitor cells downstream of tip HSCs serve as a major, nearly self-renewing source of day-to-day hematopoiesis, rendering the blood and immune system HSC-independent for extended periods of time. HSCs realize multilineage output, yet, fates restricted to several lineages or even a single lineage have also been observed. Single HSCs within a clone in the bone marrow that develop from a fetal HSC precursor have been observed to express clone-specific fates. Thus, the new tools probing HSC differentiation in situ are progressing beyond assays for HSC activity based on proliferation measurements and fates of transplanted stem cells, and the data challenge lineage interpretations of single-cell gene expression snapshots. Linking in vivo fate analyses to gene expression and other molecular determinants of cell fate will aid in unraveling the mechanisms of lineage commitment and the architecture of physiological hematopoiesis.},

Here we describe a new mouse model that mimics the transcriptional effects of 3q26 rearrangement. We show that EVI1 overexpression causes global distortion of hematopoiesis, with suppression of erythropoiesis and lymphopoiesis, and marked premalignant expansion of myelopoiesis that eventually results in leukemic transformation. We show that myeloid skewing is dependent on DNA binding by EVI1, which upregulates Spi1, encoding master myeloid regulator PU.1. We show that EVI1 binds to the −14 kb upstream regulatory element (−14kbURE) at Spi1; knockdown of Spi1 dampens the myeloid skewing. Furthermore, deletion of the −14kbURE at Spi1 abrogates the effects of EVI1 on hematopoietic stem cells. These findings support a novel mechanism of leukemogenesis through EVI1 overexpression., Chr3q26 rearrangements cause overexpression of EVI1 and associate with myeloid neoplasms, but the mechanism behind this association is unclear. Here, using a novel mouse model they show that EVI1 causes premalignant myeloid expansion with suppression of other lineages through upregulation of Spi1/PU.1.},

	abstract = {A Different Cycle for Differentiation
The regulated expression of transcription factors determines cell fate decisions during cell differentiation. The transcription factor PU.1 is an important determinant in the differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors to lymphocytes or myeloid cells, where high expression induces macrophage differentiation, whereas low expression leads to the development of B lymphocytes. How PU.1 expression levels are regulated during this cell fate choice, however, is not well understood. Kueh et al. (p. 670, published online 18 July) found that in mice, reduced transcription of PU.1 led to its reduced expression in developing B lymphocytes, whereas in macrophages, PU.1 was able to accumulate stably because of a lengthening of the cell cycle. Exogenous expression of PU.1 in progenitors supported cell cycle lengthening and macrophage differentiation, and mathematical modeling suggested that such a feedback loop could maintain a slow-dividing macrophage developmental state.
Regulatory gene circuits with positive-feedback loops control stem cell differentiation, but several mechanisms can contribute to positive feedback. Here, we dissect feedback mechanisms through which the transcription factor PU.1 controls lymphoid and myeloid differentiation. Quantitative live-cell imaging revealed that developing B cells decrease PU.1 levels by reducing PU.1 transcription, whereas developing macrophages increase PU.1 levels by lengthening their cell cycles, which causes stable PU.1 accumulation. Exogenous PU.1 expression in progenitors increases endogenous PU.1 levels by inducing cell cycle lengthening, implying positive feedback between a regulatory factor and the cell cycle. Mathematical modeling showed that this cell cycle–coupled feedback architecture effectively stabilizes a slow-dividing differentiated state. These results show that cell cycle duration functions as an integral part of a positive autoregulatory circuit to control cell fate.
Regulation of cell cycle length is a feedback mechanism that controls cell fate decisions in developing macrophages.

Since its establishment in 2009, single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has been a major driver behind progress in biomedical research. In developmental biology and stem cell studies, the ability to profile single cells confers particular benefits. Although most studies still focus on individual tissues or organs, the recent development of ultra-high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq has demonstrated potential power in characterizing more complex systems or even the entire body. However, although multiple ultra-high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq systems have attracted attention, no systematic comparison of these systems has been performed. Here, with the same cell line and bioinformatics pipeline, we developed directly comparable datasets for each of three widely used droplet-based ultra-high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq systems, inDrop, Drop-seq, and 10X Genomics Chromium. Although each system is capable of profiling single-cell transcriptomes, their detailed comparison revealed the distinguishing features and suitable applications for each system.},

Here, we show that dermal condensates (DC), signaling niches for epithelial progenitors in hair placodes, are specified before niche formation and function. With 3D/4D microscopy we identify unclustered DC precursors. With population-based and single-cell transcriptomics we define a molecular time-lapse of dynamic niche signatures and the developmental trajectory as the DC lineage emerges from fibroblasts. Co-expression of downregulated fibroblast and upregulated DC genes in niche precursors reveals a transitory molecular state following a proliferation shutdown. Waves of transcription factor and signaling molecule expression then consolidate DC niche formation. Finally, ablation of epidermal Wnt signaling and placode-derived FGF20 demonstrates their requirement for DC-precursor specification.

Embryonic axis elongation is a complex multi-tissue morphogenetic process responsible for the formation of the posterior part of the amniote body. How movements and growth are coordinated between the different posterior tissues (e.g. neural tube, axial and paraxial mesoderm, lateral plate, ectoderm, endoderm) to drive axis morphogenesis remain largely unknown. Here, we use quail embryos to quantify cell behavior and tissue movements during elongation. We quantify the tissue-specific contribution to axis elongation using 3D volumetric techniques, then quantify tissue-specific parameters such as cell density and proliferation. To study cell behavior at a multi-tissue scale, we used high-resolution 4D imaging of transgenic quail embryos expressing fluorescent proteins. We developed specific tracking and image analysis techniques to analyze cell motion and compute tissue deformations in 4D. This analysis reveals extensive sliding between tissues during axis extension. Further quantification of tissue tectonics showed patterns of rotations, contractions and expansions, which are consistent with the multi-tissue behavior observed previously. Our approach defines a quantitative and multi-scale method to analyze the coordination between tissue behaviors during early vertebrate embryo morphogenetic events.},

	abstract = {Background. Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare yet aggressive variant of breast cancer with a high recurrence rate. We hypothesized that patterns of metastasis differ between IBC and non‐IBC. We focused on the patterns of bone metastasis throughout disease progression to determine statistical differences that can lead to clinically relevant outcomes. Our primary outcome of this study is to quantify and describe this difference with a view to applying the findings to clinically relevant outcomes for patients.
Subjects, Materials, and Methods. We retrospectively collected data of patients with nonmetastatic IBC (n = 299) and non‐IBC (n = 3,436). Probabilities of future site‐specific metastases were calculated. Spread patterns were visualized to quantify the most probable metastatic pathways of progression and to categorize spread pattern based on their propensity to subsequent dissemination of cancer.
Results. In patients with IBC, the probabilities of developing bone metastasis after chest wall, lung, or liver metastasis as the first site of progression were high: 28\%, 21\%, and 21\%, respectively. For patients with non‐IBC, the probability of developing bone metastasis was fairly consistent regardless of initial metastasis site.
Conclusion. Metastatic patterns of spread differ between patients with IBC and non‐IBC. Selection of patients with IBC with known liver, chest wall, and/or lung metastasis would create a population in whom to investigate effective methods for preventing future bone metastasis.
Implications for Practice. This study demonstrated that the patterns of metastasis leading to and following bone metastasis differ significantly between patients with inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) and those with non‐IBC. Patients with IBC had a progression pattern that tended toward the development of bone metastasis if they had previously developed metastases in the liver, chest wall, and lung, rather than in other sites. Selection of patients with IBC with known liver, chest wall, and/or lung metastasis would create a population in whom to investigate effective methods for preventing future bone metastasis.},

Here, we review relevant dynamical-systems approaches to describe the state transition between stem and differentiated cells, with an emphasis on fluctuating and oscillatory gene expression levels, as these represent the specific properties of stem cells. Relevance between recent experimental results and dynamical-systems descriptions of stem cell differentiation is also discussed.},

However, dimension reduction is unavoidably prone to introducing artefacts, and we hence need means to see where a dimension-reduced embedding is a faithful representation of the local neighbourhood and where it is not. We present Sleepwalk, a simple but powerful tool that allows the user to interactively explore an embedding, using colour to depict "true" similarities of all points to the cell under the mouse cursor. We show how this approach not only highlights distortions, but also reveals otherwise hidden characteristics of the data, and how Sleepwalk9s comparative modes help integrate multi-sample data and understand differences between embedding and preprocessing methods. Sleepwalk is a versatile and intuitive tool that unlocks the full power of dimension reduction and will be of value not only in single-cell RNA-Seq but also in any other area with matrix-shaped big data.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here, we report a comprehensive genomic survey for somatic events in systemic metastatic prostate tumors using both high-resolution copy number analysis and targeted mutational survey of 3508 exons from 577 cancer-related genes using next generation sequencing. Focal homozygous deletions were detected at 8p22, 10q23.31, 13q13.1, 13q14.11, and 13q14.12. Key genes mapping within these deleted regions include PTEN, BRCA2, C13ORF15, and SIAH3. Focal high-level amplifications were detected at 5p13.2-p12, 14q21.1, 7q22.1, and Xq12. Key amplified genes mapping within these regions include SKP2, FOXA1, and AR. Furthermore, targeted mutational analysis of normal-tumor pairs has identified somatic mutations in genes known to be associated with prostate cancer including AR and TP53, but has also revealed novel somatic point mutations in genes including MTOR, BRCA2, ARHGEF12, and CHD5. Finally, in one patient where multiple independent metastatic tumors were available, we show common and divergent somatic alterations that occur at both the copy number and point mutation level, supporting a model for a common clonal progenitor with metastatic tumor-specific divergence. Our study represents a deep genomic analysis of advanced metastatic prostate tumors and has revealed candidate somatic alterations, possibly contributing to lethal prostate cancer.},

Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) maintain the adult blood system, and their dysregulation causes a multitude of diseases. However, the differentiation journeys toward specific hematopoietic lineages remain ill defined, and system-wide disease interpretation remains challenging. Here, we have profiled 44 802 mouse bone marrow HSPCs using single-cell RNA sequencing to provide a comprehensive transcriptional landscape with entry points to 8 different blood lineages (lymphoid, megakaryocyte, erythroid, neutrophil, monocyte, eosinophil, mast cell, and basophil progenitors). We identified a common basophil/mast cell bone marrow progenitor and characterized its molecular profile at the single-cell level. Transcriptional profiling of 13 815 HSPCs from the c-Kit mutant (W41/W41) mouse model revealed the absence of a distinct mast cell lineage entry point, together with global shifts in cell type abundance. Proliferative defects were accompanied by reduced Myc expression. Potential compensatory processes included upregulation of the integrated stress response pathway and downregulation of proapoptotic gene expression in erythroid progenitors, thus providing a template of how large-scale single-cell transcriptomic studies can bridge between molecular phenotypes and quantitative population changes.},

	abstract = {Deep learning describes a class of machine learning algorithms that are capable of combining raw inputs into layers of intermediate features. These algorithms have recently shown impressive results across a variety of domains. Biology and medicine are data-rich disciplines, but the data are complex and often ill-understood. Hence, deep learning techniques may be particularly well suited to solve problems of these fields. We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems—patient classification, fundamental biological processes and treatment of patients—and discuss whether deep learning will be able to transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. Following from an extensive literature review, we find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize biomedicine or definitively resolve any of the most pressing challenges in the field, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even though improvements over previous baselines have been modest in general, the recent progress indicates that deep learning methods will provide valuable means for speeding up or aiding human investigation. Though progress has been made linking a specific neural network's prediction to input features, understanding how users should interpret these models to make testable hypotheses about the system under study remains an open challenge. Furthermore, the limited amount of labelled data for training presents problems in some domains, as do legal and privacy constraints on work with sensitive health records. Nonetheless, we foresee deep learning enabling changes at both bench and bedside with the potential to transform several areas of biology and medicine.},

As a result of this heterogeneity, the bulk tumour might include a diverse collection of cells harbouring distinct molecular signatures with differential levels of sensitivity to treatment. This heterogeneity might result in a non-uniform distribution of genetically distinct tumour-cell subpopulations across and within disease sites (spatial heterogeneity) or temporal variations in the molecular makeup of cancer cells (temporal heterogeneity). Heterogeneity provides the fuel for resistance; therefore, an accurate assessment of tumour heterogeneity is essential for the development of effective therapies. Multiregion sequencing, single-cell sequencing, analysis of autopsy samples, and longitudinal analysis of liquid biopsy samples are all emerging technologies with considerable potential to dissect the complex clonal architecture of cancers. In this Review, we discuss the driving forces behind intratumoural heterogeneity and the current approaches used to combat this heterogeneity and its consequences. We also explore how clinical assessments of tumour heterogeneity might facilitate the development of more-effective personalized therapies.},

Hence, biomarkers need to be developed that enable the stratification of patients with CRC into different prognostic subgroups and in relation to response to therapies, according to the distinctive tumour biology. Currently, only RAS-mutation status is used routinely as a negative predictive marker to avoid treatment with anti-EGFR agents in patients with metastatic CRC, and mismatch-repair status can guide the use of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with early stage colon cancer. Advances in molecular biology over the past decade have enabled a better understanding of the development of CRC, as well as the more-precise use of innovative targeted therapies for this disease, and include three fundamental achievements. First, the availability of large databases to capture and store the genomic landscape of patients with CRC, providing information on the genes that are frequently deregulated in CRC. Second, the possibility of using gene-expression profiling to differentiate the subtypes of CRC into prognostic groups. Third, results from highly sensitive next-generation sequencing analyses have led to an appreciation of the extensive intratumoural heterogeneity of CRC. Herein, we discuss these advances and place them into the clinical context, and present the novel targets and therapeutic opportunities that are on the horizon.},

	abstract = {The immune system has the greatest potential for the specific destruction of tumours with no toxicity to normal tissue and for long-term memory that can prevent cancer recurrence. The last 30 years of immuno-oncology research have provided solid evidence that tumours are recognised by the immune system and their development can be stopped or controlled long term through a process known as immunosurveillance. Tumour specificity of the immune response resides in the recognition of tumour antigens. Viral proteins in tumours caused by viruses and mutated proteins from oncogenes or other genes, as well as nonmutated but abnormally expressed self proteins found on all tumours, have been shown to be good antigens and good targets for immunosurveillance. In many cancers, however, malignant progression is accompanied by profound immune suppression that interferes with an effective antitumour response and tumour elimination. Initially, most of the escape from immunosurveillance was ascribed to changes in the tumour cells themselves (loss of tumour antigens, loss of human leukocyte antigen molecules, loss of sensitivity to complement, or T cell or natural killer (NK) cell lysis), making them a poor target of an immune attack. However, it has become clear that the suppression comes from the ability of tumours to subvert normal immune regulation to their advantage. The tumour microenvironment can prevent the expansion of tumour antigen-specific helper and cytotoxic T cells and instead promote the production of proinflammatory cytokines and other factors, leading to the accumulation of suppressive cell populations that inhibit instead of promote immunity. The best described are regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Great conceptual and technical advances in the field of immuno-oncology over the past 30 years have provided us with the knowledge and techniques to develop novel immunotherapeutic approaches for the treatment of cancer. These include methods that enhance tumour immunity by blocking inhibitory pathways and inhibitory cells in the tumour microenvironment (e.g. antibodies against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4, programmed death 1 or its ligand programmed death ligand 1, or low-dose chemotherapy). Of equal importance, they include methods that can enhance the specificity of antitumour immunity by inducing the expansion of T cells and antibodies directed to well-defined tumour antigens (e.g. cancer vaccines, potent adjuvants, immunostimulatory cytokines). Even as monotherapies, these approaches are having a substantial impact on the treatment of some patients with advanced, previously untreatable, malignancies. Most exciting of all, these successes provide a rationale to expect that used in various combinations or earlier in disease, current and future immunotherapies may transform cancer treatment, improving a prognosis for many patients.},

Using a microwell device, we analyzed cell growth within hundreds of replicate microbial communities consisting of two species and small population sizes. The wells of the devices were inoculated with a coculture of Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae. Each species expressed a unique fluorescent protein enabling simultaneously tracking of cell number for each species over time. Growth dynamics within the device were consistent with bulk measurements.

This process, commonly known as quorum sensing, aids in the regulation of genes crucial for the survival of species within heterogeneous populations of microbes. Although signal exchange was studied extensively in well-mixed environments, less is known about the consequences of crosstalk in spatially distributed mixtures of species. Here, signaling dynamics were measured in a spatially distributed system containing multiple strains utilizing homologous signaling systems. Crosstalk between strains containing the lux, las and rhl AHL-receptor circuits was quantified. In a distributed population of microbes, the impact of community composition on spatio-temporal dynamics was characterized and compared to simulation results using a modified reaction-diffusion model. After introducing a single term to account for crosstalk between each pair of signals, the model was able to reproduce the activation patterns observed in experiments. We quantified the robustness of signal propagation in the presence of interacting signals, finding that signaling dynamics are largely robust to interference. The ability of several wild isolates to participate in AHL-mediated signaling was investigated, revealing distinct signatures of crosstalk for each species. Our results present a route to characterize crosstalk between species and predict systems-level signaling dynamics in multispecies communities.},

Model simulations show how stochastic interactions between tumor cells and stroma may lead to a structural suppression of tumor growth, modest proliferation, or unopposed tumor growth. The model incorporates key aspects of prostate tumor progression, including transforming growth factor-$\beta$ (TGF-$\beta$), matrix-degrading enzyme activity, and stromal activation. It also examines the importance of TGF-$\beta$ during tumor progression and the role of stromal cell density in regulating tumor growth. The validity of one of the key predictions of the model about the effect of epithelial TGF-$\beta$ production on glandular stability was tested in vivo. These experimental results confirmed the ability of the model to generate testable biological predictions in addition to providing new avenues of experimental interest.

	abstract = {During the last decade, our understanding of cancer cell signaling networks has significantly improved, leading to the development of various targeted therapies that have elicited profound but, unfortunately, short-lived responses. This is, in part, due to the fact that these targeted therapies ignore context and average out heterogeneity. Here, we present a mathematical framework that addresses the impact of signaling heterogeneity on targeted therapy outcomes. We employ a simplified oncogenic rat sarcoma (RAS)-driven mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase-protein kinase B (PI3K-AKT) signaling pathway in lung cancer as an experimental model system and develop a network model of the pathway. We measure how inhibition of the pathway modulates protein phosphorylation as well as cell viability under different microenvironmental conditions. Training the model on this data using Monte Carlo simulation results in a suite of in silico cells whose relative protein activities and cell viability match experimental observation. The calibrated model predicts distributional responses to kinase inhibitors and suggests drug resistance mechanisms that can be exploited in drug combination strategies. The suggested combination strategies are validated using in vitro experimental data. The validated in silico cells are further interrogated through an unsupervised clustering analysis and then integrated into a mathematical model of tumor growth in a homogeneous and resource-limited microenvironment. We assess posttreatment heterogeneity and predict vast differences across treatments with similar efficacy, further emphasizing that heterogeneity should modulate treatment strategies. The signaling model is also integrated into a hybrid cellular automata (HCA) model of tumor growth in a spatially heterogeneous microenvironment. As a proof of concept, we simulate tumor responses to targeted therapies in a spatially segregated tissue structure containing tumor and stroma (derived from patient tissue) and predict complex cell signaling responses that suggest a novel combination treatment strategy.},

In this work, we investigate interactions between a growing tumor and its surrounding stroma and their role in facilitating the emergence of drug resistance. We used mathematical modeling as a theoretical framework to bridge between experimental models and scales, with the aim of separating intrinsic and extrinsic components of resistance in BRAF-mutated melanoma; the model describes tumor-stroma dynamics both with and without treatment.

Through the integration of a simple mathematical model with in vitro and in vivo experimental growth dynamics of melanoma cell lines (both with and without drug), we were able to dissect the relative contributions of intrinsic versus environmental resistance. Our study revealed significant heterogeneity in vivo, indicating that there is a diversity of either stromal promotion or tumor carrying capacity under targeted therapy. We believe this variation may be one possible explanation for the heterogeneity observed across patients and within individual patients with multiple metastases. Therefore, quantifying this variation both within in vivo model systems and in individual patients could have a significant impact on the design of future treatment strategies that target both tumor and stroma. Further, we present guidelines for building more effective and longer lasting therapeutic strategies utilizing our experimentally calibrated model. These strategies explicitly consider the protective nature of the stroma and utilize inhibitors that modulate it.},

Similarly to the original, radially symmetric model, the quantities we follow depend on a phenotype variable that corresponds to the level of drug resistance. The original model is modified in three ways: (i) We consider a more general growth term that takes into account the sensitivity of resistance level to high drug dosage. (ii) We add a diffusion term in space for the cancer cells and adjust all diffusion terms (for the nutrients and for the drugs) so that the permeability of the resource and drug is limited by the cell concentration. (iii) We add a mutation term with a mutation kernel that corresponds to mutations that occur regularly or rarely. We study the dynamics of the emerging resistance of the cancer cells under continuous infusion and on–off infusion of cytotoxic and cytostatic drugs. While the original Lorz model has an asymptotic profile in which the cancer cells are either fully resistant or fully sensitive, our model allows the emergence of partial resistance levels. We show that increased drug concentrations are correlated with delayed relapse. However, when the cancer relapses, more resistant traits are selected. We further show that an on–off drug infusion also selects for more resistant traits when compared with a continuous drug infusion of identical total drug concentrations. Under certain conditions, our model predicts the emergence of a heterogeneous tumor in which cancer cells of different resistance levels coexist in different areas in space.},

	abstract = {Intratumoral heterogeneity has been found to be a major cause of drug resistance. Cell-to-cell variation increases as a result of cancer-related alterations, which are acquired by stochastic events and further induced by environmental signals. However, most cellular mechanisms include natural ﬂuctuations that are closely regulated, and thus lead to asynchronization of the cells, which causes intrinsic heterogeneity in a given population. Here, we derive two novel mathematical models, a stochastic agent-based model and an integro-differential equation model, each of which describes the growth of cancer cells as a dynamic transition between proliferative and quiescent states. These models are designed to predict variations in growth as a function of the intrinsic heterogeneity emerging from the durations of the cellcycle and apoptosis, and also include cellular density dependencies. By examining the role all parameters play in the evolution of intrinsic tumor heterogeneity, and the sensitivity of the population growth to parameter values, we show that the cell-cycle length has the most signiﬁcant effect on the growth dynamics. In addition, we demonstrate that the agent-based model can be approximated well by the more computationally efﬁcient integro-differential equations when the number of cells is large. This essential step in cancer growth modeling will allow us to revisit the mechanisms of multidrug resistance by examining spatiotemporal differences of cell growth while administering a drug among the different sub-populations in a single tumor, as well as the evolution of those mechanisms as a function of the resistance level.},

	abstract = {Recent data have demonstrated that cancer drug resistance reflects complex biologic factors, including tumor heterogeneity, varying growth, differentiation, apoptosis pathways, and cell density. As a result, there is a need to find new ways to incorporate these complexities in the mathematical modeling of multidrug resistance. Here, we derive a novel structured population model that describes the behavior of cancer cells under selection with cytotoxic drugs. Our model is designed to estimate intratumoral heterogeneity as a function of the resistance level and time. This updated model of the multidrug resistance problem integrates both genetic and epigenetic changes, density dependence, and intratumoral heterogeneity. Our results suggest that treatment acts as a selection process, whereas genetic/epigenetic alteration rates act as a diffusion process. Application of our model to cancer treatment suggests that reducing alteration rates as a first step in treatment causes a reduction in tumor heterogeneity and may improve targeted therapy. The new insight provided by this model could help to dramatically change the ability of clinical oncologists to design new treatment protocols and analyze the response of patients to therapy.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}A new ecologically inspired paradigm in cancer treatment known as "adaptive therapy" capitalizes on competitive interactions between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant subclones. The goal of adaptive therapy is to maintain a controllable stable tumor burden by allowing a significant population of treatment sensitive cells to survive which in turn suppress proliferation of the less fit resistant populations. This adaptive approach means that each patient9s treatment is truly personalized based on the tumor9s response rather than a one-size-fits-all fixed treatment regime. However, there remain several open challenges in designing adaptive therapies, particularly in extending these therapeutic concepts to multiple treatments. We present a simple extension of a previously developed model of metastatic prostate cancer to a frequency-dependent domain as a case study and point of departure to illustrate three novel concepts to aid the design of multi-drug adaptive therapies. First, frequency-dependent "cycles" of tumor evolution can trap tumor evolution in a periodic, controllable loop. Second, the availability and selection of treatments may limit the evolutionary "search space" reachable by the tumor. Third, the velocity of evolution is important to the timing of drug sequences. By noting that the stated goal of adaptive therapy is to maintain a stable tumor volume while controlling the tumor composition, we can make the simplifying assumption of a (relatively) constant tumor volume. We explain the importance of modeling frequency-dependent dynamics at play within a tumor, and show how these three concepts (evolutionary cycles, evolutionary search space, and evolutionary velocity) aid the selection of drugs and design of treatment schedules in multi-drug adaptive therapy.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {To provide a better understanding of the relationship between primary tumor growth rates and metastatic burden, we present a method that bridges tumor growth dynamics at the population level, extracted from the SEER database, to those at the tissue level. Specifically, with this method, we are able to relate estimates of tumor growth rates and metastatic burden derived from a population-level model to estimates of the primary tumor vascular response and the circulating tumor cell (CTC) fraction derived from a tissue-level model. Variation in the population-level model parameters produces differences in cancer-specific survival and cure fraction. Variation in the tissue-level model parameters produces different primary tumor dynamics that subsequently lead to different growth dynamics of the CTCs. Our method to bridge the population and tissue scales was applied to lung and breast cancer separately, and the results were compared. The population model suggests that lung tumors grow faster and shed a significant number of lethal metastatic cells at small sizes, whereas breast tumors grow slower and do not significantly shed lethal metastatic cells until becoming larger. Although the tissue-level model does not explicitly model the metastatic population, we are able to disengage the direct dependency of the metastatic burden on primary tumor growth by introducing the CTC population as an intermediary and assuming dependency. We calibrate the tissue-level model to produce results consistent with the population model while also revealing a more dynamic relationship between the primary tumor and the CTCs. This leads to exponential tumor growth in lung and power law tumor growth in breast. We conclude that the vascular response of the primary tumor is a major player in the dynamics of both the primary tumor and the CTCs, and is significantly different in breast and lung cancer.
